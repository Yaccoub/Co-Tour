Date of experience: December 2019,Interesting & Entertaining,"We visited the museum after spending time at Nymphenburg Palace, as the museum is next door. As it's been previously mentioned, the information is all written in German. I have a rudimentary understanding of German and this was a wonderful experience of testing my German skills.",50,,
Date of experience: December 2018,To visit,"Fascinating. Illuminating. And interestingly presented (please note, much of the info is only in German). Bring lots of time and curiosity.

Date of experience: November 2018,Entertaining museum ,"Lots to learn about nature and people. Not expensive:,3.5€ per person.

",40,"Munich, Germany",
Date of experience: April 2018,Only in german but still interesting,We were here for one hour even tho we didn't really understand anything :).

On,30,"Espoo, Finland",
Date of experience: March 2018,Zeitverlust,"I do not recommend it. Everything ist extremly old and not hygienic (100 old telephone receivers to hear anything).

Date of experience: January 2018,"Very nice museum, especially for kids","This is a great and well done museum about the history of our planet and humanity.

Takes around an hour to 1.5 hours to do all",50,"Sydney, Australia",
Date of experience: September 2017,Worth its money and more!,"A week before visiting this place we were at the Deutsche Museum.

One small details that justifies most of the things is its",50,"Vancouver, Canada",
Date of experience: March 2017,No English at all -   so don't waste your kid s time to go,"We travelled 45 mins by tram, finally found the museum with my 13years old boy.

And the Cafe on the ground floor was a mess, no seats,",10,"London, United Kingdom",
Date of experience: March 2017,"Location for special exhihbition ""Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2017""","We visited the speical exhibition ""Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2017"" in the beautiful museum as part of the Nymphenburg Palace. Very impressed...",50,"Munich, Germany",

Date of experience: February 2017,You can't be too old to enjoy science,Sunday afternoon crowded by families with little children.

Date of experience: August 2016,A nice surprise,"We wandered in the museum by accident and we loved it. It's packed with interactive stuff and therefore a lot of fun, especially for kids.

Date of experience: December 2013,Surprising and interesting,"We didn't plan the visit, but we were at Nymphenburg Palace and we saw the museum on our way to the car.
