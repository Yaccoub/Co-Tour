My companion and I arrived in the evening, perhaps two hours before closing time, and we still only had time to hit the major highlights and walk quickly through certain sections.  To list a few of my favorite exhibits:Creches-on the lower level the museum has a vast display of nativity scenes (sort of like fancy dioramas), ranging from simple and austere to grand urban scenes.  The tiny details in some of the displays are amazing.Period rooms-there are several rooms recreating Gothic-era furniture and interior décor, which were much more colorful than I expected.Architectural models-a large room features architectural models of various German cities, from the very large (Munich), to the small.  Homes, churches, halls, and shops are all recreated in minute detail.  The museum has a vast collection of regional art (paintings, sculptures), artifacts (decorative and mundane, religious and secular), and weaponry from the medieval era to the present.  Most displays were provided in both German and English.  One can easily spend many hours wandering around.  As stated above, we arrived in the evening, and there were few other people, so at times it felt like we had the entire building to ourselves.

Date of experience: January 2019,Nativity scene display was magnificent.,"We really enjoyed the nativity scenes from all over the world. They were incredibly detailed and beautiful. The staff was very nice and helpful. You didn't have to pay to use the toilet, which is a real plus in Germany. (Really, but they are very clean so it's worth it.) The rest of the museum was good but the nativity scenes were great.",40,"Dover, Delaware",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: December 2018,Ricordo storico,"Museo con tantissimi oggetti storici,  posizionati in base al periodo, si passa dal medioevo al rinascimento e cosi via,  ti mostra accuratamente  la storia di questa regione.

Date of experience: January 2019,Grande sfoggio d'altri tempi,"Un museo enorme, con grandi sale arredate a seconda del periodo degli oggetti o delle sculture presenti. Qui c'è davvero un grande campionario di storia, da quella antica, passando per quella ecclesiastica, fino a quella rinascimentale. E' l'ideale per una giornata di maltempo, ma in generale sarebbe un peccato perdersi questa struttura museale.",50,"Milan, Italy",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: November 2018,Very odd place,This was an interesting museum. It seemed to me like it had quite a bit of potential to be a highly interesting and informative place. However the place was very inconsistent I the way it was setup. I got an English language audio guide...only a small portion of the museum had audio guide assistance available. This was not so bad in places because many items had a description next to them in German and English...however...and this is where the museum lacked the most for me...only about 1/2 the museum had the English signage. Some rooms were completely in German and that was all. I was hoping to get a better understanding of life in Bavaria in the past and I did not leave with that.  With that being said there were some interesting items but overall probably was not worth my time.,30,"Cincinnati, Ohio",Trip type: Traveled solo
