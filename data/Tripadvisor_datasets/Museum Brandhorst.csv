Date of experience: September 2016,If you love modern/contemporary art...this is a great place!,This was on the top of my list for museums I wanted to visit in Munich and it didn't disappoint!

Unfortunately you don’t get to see this collection, as you don’t see the works by Hurst, Koons, Chamberlain etc...

The current exhibition with Kerstin Brätsch's works is enormous. Not only a number of rooms are dedicated to her work, but her paper and oil works are huge. She has an affinity for Brätsch compressors--the company logo as well as multiple depictions of the machines are everywhere. Is it a family company, or is the interest due to the name? Not a fan of that particular cross-pollination--seemed forced, unnecessary. Her glass work using full sheets of colored glass was interesting. I much prefer the glasswork of others who specialize in the medium (no, I'm not talking about Chihuly, though I love his work). The delight in this visit was the Cy Twombly works.

Date of experience: March 2017,A feast of Cy Twombly!,"The Brandhorst Museum is, in effect, a boutique museum of contemporary and semi-contemporary art.  Relatively few objects are displayed in a wonderful architectural space.  I gather that there is a permanent collection from which a selection is made to form a rotating thematic exhibition on the main floor, while on the top floor and in the basement two temporary exhibitions are displayed.  On the top floor presently -- and perhaps, one assumes, permanently, though this is not stated -- is what is in effect a complete retrospective of the career of the American artist Cy Twombly, based in Italy for much of the later part of his life.  The presentation is truly, staggeringly, magnificent.  The Lepanto and Roses sequences, displayed in immense, beautifully lit spaces, are mind-blowing, as is the room devoted to works with a nautical theme.  The museum brochure is surely correct in its statement that these sequences are the equivalent of Monet's Nympheas at the Orangerie or the display in the Marmottan basement of the same artist.  Not to mention Turner's seascapes, of which Twombly's work is immediately reminiscent.  To see Twombly's work in all its various manifestations -- painting, sculpture, graffiti, photography, multimedia -- revealed, to me anyway, someone not at all familiar with his career as a whole, the greatness of the man.  The other show on view currently, Wade Guyton's New York Studio, seemed good and interesting to me, but after the Twombly, I couldn't absorb it.  The works from the permanent collection, on the other hand, organized on the theme ""ship ahoy"", were most interesting and well explained.  This is a very fine museum, which also happens to be very beautiful on the outside as well.  The sad part, I suppose, is that the museum is virtually empty, given Munich's more ""important"" museums.

Partendo da una collezione privata (quindi senza pretesa di essere esaustivo, ma legato invece ai gusti del collezionista), il museo offre uno sguardo molto particolare sull'arte contemporanea più recente, con opere di artisti maggiori o minori, anche abbastanza spiazzanti e poco viste (ad esempio i tre Warhol che sono assolutamente originali rispetto alla produzione classica). Pezzi ben scelti e soprattutto ben esposti, con molta ""aria"" e spazio fra un'opera e un'altra. Oltretutto, quando siamo stati noi, l'afflusso era assolutamente congruo rispetto all'ampiezza delle sale. Il personale è cortese e attento (e la ragazza alla reception parlava benissimo italiano). La struttura è architettonicamente lineare, ma per questo giustamente neutra rispetto alle opere. L'esterno è molto bello con il rivestimento in listelli colorati che richiama certe cose di Renzo Piano.
