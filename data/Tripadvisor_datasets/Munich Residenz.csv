Tourist information in Munich really underplays how stunning this place is. And it’s an easy walk from Marienplatz. My only regret is that we had only reserved a few hours to see it.

If you were to take the long tour and listen to every part of the audio tour I think that you could easily spend the whole day exploring it. The main part of the tour was incredibly interesting, with a large selection of items to few and learn about.

All'interno del museo della Residenz si può anche scegliere di prendere l'audio guida. Il percorso è meraviglioso poichè ogni stanza della residenz ha una sua pculiarità! Anche il Teatro Cuvilliés e il tesoro meritano di essere visitati!",40,"Rimini, Emilia-Romagna, Italy",
Date of experience: September 2019,Bellissima e interminabile esperienza,"È un enorme complesso che ha ospitato la casa regnante della Baviera (i Wittelsbach) per diversi secoli. L’edificio, in realtà, è un insieme di edifici frutto degli ampliamenti successivi da parte dei principi che si sono succeduti. Entriamo alle 11:00 sapendo che ci aspetterà una visita impegnativa; le stanze da visitare sono ben 130. Il costo del biglietto e di 11€ compresa l’audioguida in italiano che ci viene consegnata, guarda caso, da una ragazza italiana. Per le foto non ci sono limiti. Cominciamo, così, il percorso guidato con l’aiuto dell’audioguida. Descrivere nel dettaglio tutta la visita sarebbe un’operazione lunga e, pertanto, segnalo le cose più importanti: l’Antiquarium, una grande sala affrescata contenente numerosi busti di imperatori romani, la camera del trono, la statua di San Giorgio ricoperta di una infinità di diamanti, la camera del tesoro, il Grottenhof con la fontana di Perseo e …………….... mi fermo qui. Ci aiuta molto l’audioguida esaustiva e completa. Le ultime trenta stanze, sfiniti e con gli occhi pieni di tesori, le facciamo senza audioguida e a passo più svelto. Consegniamo le audioguide e dopo ben 4 ore di visita, stanchi ma soddisfatti, usciamo dal palazzo. Una esperienza davvero bella, da non perdere assolutamente.",50,,

La residenza è stata per secoli il luogo di residenza e la sede del governo dei duchi, poi dei principi elettori e infine dei re di Baviera. E' enorme, ci sono una moltitudine di stanze, una più bella dell'altra. Che dire di più: se visitate Monaco la visita è d'obbligo.",50,"Brembate di Sopra, Italy",

Date of experience: February 2020,Awesome,The Residenz is a very large palace which is a must see. The insides are beautifully decorated with the rooms differently set out and richly ornate. The whole complex is extremely well presented with lavish furniture and beautiful pictures everywhere. Due to the size it does take some time to make the most of it at least 2 to 3 hours but every second is worth it.There is also the Treasury and the Cuvilliés Theatre for which there is an extra charge to view. We did the treasury but missed the Cuvilles Theatre but if the main palace is anything to go by it should also be superb.You cannot go to Munich and miss the out the Residenz. It is well worth the investment of your time and effort,50,"Upholland, United Kingdom",
Date of experience: February 2020,Gaste = flabbered,"This place is monumentally huge! There is so much to see it is hard to know where to begin.Actually it was quite easy to know where to begin because a helpful member of staff pointed me in the right direction. But that isn't quite what I mean. What I mean is, it is difficult to know which bit to focus on first when writing about it, as there is so much, so very much.I bought a ticket for the Residenz and the Treasury and made my way in following red signs. I was guided from room to ornate room dripping with paintings, furniture, tapestries and assorted royal blingery any one of which you could write a book about. After a while (and I appreciate how ignorant this makes me sound) it all starts to blur into one and I found myself thinking ""I'm sure I've been in this room before."" The endless complex of rooms, corridors, chambers and antechambers had me wondering if when I came out I was going to emerge in Stuttgart.However, I made my way round what I think was most of the rooms that are open to visitors. I think there were about 16 million of them but I lost count part way. There were throne rooms (several) bed rooms (both ceremonial and for sleeping), reception rooms, a chapel, a room housing a collection of bronze statues, a room housing bizarre and unsettling religious relics, a room housing gold rings, two turtle doves and for all I know a partridge in a very royal pear tree. It's all a bit of a blur.While my comments may sound flippant this was part of the joy of visiting this site - and it really was a joy. You could let it all wash over you and just be blown away by the scale and richness of the rooms on display.Eventually I came to the end and noticed that I had done the tour without the benefit of the free audio guides. So I did it again.Occasionally I found myself standing back unable to decide if a room made mostly out of gold was either the most beautiful room I had ever seen or the most hideous. However, the one thing I was always sure about is that I wouldn't like to dust it.If you're in Munich and have a two or three months to kill you really must visit the Residenz. I have never been anywhere like it.",50,Scotland,

Date of experience: January 2020,Highlight of Visit ,"I’ve visited Munich several times over the years and somehow missed the Residenz even though it’s in the heart of the city.   From the outside it’s unassuming, but interior reveals wealth, history, and a world that has passed.  Much of the building and it’s contents were destroyed during World War II and has been restored, other items are just empty highlighting what’s been lost.  I decided to just to the main self guided tour for 9 euros and spend almost 3 hours taking the long route.  The great hall early in is spectacular, many of the room transport you back in time.  I did skip or quickly walk through the endless rooms of table settings and vases instead looking at the art and furniture.   It was a great visit and something I’d not planned on.  Well with the visit.  Next time I may tour the theater and / or treasury (separate admission).   Highly recommended and a great cold or rainy day activity.",50,"Flanders, New Jersey",Trip type: Traveled solo
Date of experience: February 2020,Роскошь и великолепие дворцов могут много рассказать о пережитых Резиденцией временах и просто порадовать глаз туриста,"Огромный дворец правившей в Баварии (и не только) династии Виттельсбахов ведет свое происхождение от Средневекового замка Нойвесте. Столетиями он достраивался и расширялся, превратившись в огромный дворцовый комплекс, включающий здания в различных архитектурных стилях. Эпохи ренессанса, барокко, роккоко и классицизма отразились как во внешнем облике, так и внутреннем убранстве дворцов, наполненных прекрасными предметами роскоши. Хотя сам дворец сильно пострадал в годы Второй мировой войны, многие ценности были спасены и заняли свои места в восстановленной резиденции.Осмотр всего комплекса требует сил и времени, так что если на его посещение выделен лишь один день (что определенно мало), в первую очередь стоит посетить сокровищницу. Здесь хранится не только впечатляющая коллекция драгоценностей (некоторые посетительницы просто всхлипывали, глядя на средневековые короны и королевские украшения), но и ценные исторические и религиозные артефакты. Прогулка по дворцу с аудио(гидом) конечно даст максимально полное представление об увиденном, но займет немало времени. Если же его отведено немного, имеет смысл заранее познакомиться с историей Резиденции и ее наиболее известных обитателей, что сделает осмотр музея куда интереснее и эффективнее.Любопытный факт, но в музей дворцовый комплекс начал превращаться с согласия и по желанию его владельцев задолго до эпохи всеобщих национализаций. Роскошь и великолепие покоев могут много рассказать о пережитых Резиденцией и его хозяевами временах и просто порадовать глаз туриста.",50,"Moscow, Russia",

Date of experience: January 2020,Amazing Display of Wealth,"We visited in the winter, so this turned out to be a great indoor activity for a cold, snowy day.  It was worth it to get the combined ticket (Residenz, treasury, opera theater) that came with a self-paced audio guide. Allot at least 4 hours to see all three; more if you enjoy digging into every single recording on the audio guide.  Room after room of tremendous royal wealth and pageantry are on display throughout the entire Residenz complex.  The grotto and Antiquarium are definitely the highlights.  There are also several ingeniously designed pieces of furniture in the rooms for the mechanically inclined.  As some have noted, much of the structure has been restored.  However, don't get too hung up over that. You'll be hard pressed to find anything in Europe that doesn't bear the scars of WWII.  What you see on display today includes the most important original pieces of art along with rooms were painstakingly recreated using original pieces saved from the war.  The antiquarium and grotto alone are worth the price of admission, and there is enough grandeur surviving from the restoration to impart a good sense what life must have been like during the time of the kings.",50,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",
Date of experience: December 2019, Nice but unfortunately not original,"If you are into Baroque, this would be a great place to see. Unfortunately most of it was destroyed in WWII, so what you see is a great reconstruction job (which by the way has been done beautifully), but unfortunately very little of the original palace, it’s furnishings and art have survived. It is, however, still very nice to see. There are 130+ rooms to see plus the treasury. We only had two hours to spare, so skipped the treasury (you can buy tickets for both together or separately at The Residenz, but not online). Two hours was not enough to do justice to the palace and we had to skip the audio guide too. So I would recommend 3 to 4 hours to do this place justice. Audio guides are available for free with the ticket, but if you are on express visit, you can get by reading fairly well done signage which is in every room in German and English.",40,"Sydney, Australia",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Il biglietto cumulativo d'ingresso per vedere tutto questo splendore costa 17€ (attenzione al teatro perchè apre solo dalle 14 alle 17, dunque se andate in mattinata vi faranno il ticket solo per palazzo e camera del tesoro a 14€ e se vorrete visitare il teatro dovrete pagare ulteriori 5€ all'ingresso di quest'ultimo).Armatevi di molta pazienza perchè per visitare l'intero complesso ci vogliono 2/3 ore.La stanza che colpisce maggiormente il visitatore per sfarzo e raffinatezza è sicuramente la galleria degli antenati con i ritratti dei più importanti membri della famiglia Wittelsbach dalle origini fino a Ludwig III l'ultimo Re di Baviera.La camera del tesoro ospita la corona, con lo scettro ed il globo, realizzati per il primo re bavarese e la cinquecentesca statua di San Giorgio, ricoperta da 2.291 diamanti, 406 rubini e 209 perle.",50,"Olgiate Olona, Italy",

Date of experience: December 2019,Well Worth the Time,"What can I say? If you've got a couple of hours in Munich then this is the place to go. OK so eventually you'll get somewhat punch drunk from seeing so many rooms full of oppulance but there are some real gems.I'd not expected a gem like this in Bavaria, which is my fault. Its got hints of Versailles, St Petersburg and Salzburg all rolled into one.It costs about the same as a pint of beer to visit.

Date of experience: November 2019,Really enjoyable visit,"We enjoyed our tour of the Residenz! We were there for opening hour, bought our tickets (cash only!!) and got our audio guides. THere's a cloakroom/baggage area to leave coats and bags/backpacks above a certain side. We strolled around the Residenz. There was a lot of detail in the audio guide - to be honest, almost too much detail sometimes.  Allow sufficient time for visit - at least 2 hours for comfort.",50,"Dublin, Ireland",
Date of experience: December 2019,Veramente notevole,"Residenz si trova a pochi passi da Marienplatz ed è una visita imperdibile. Preparatevi però a camminare parecchio perchè il palazzo è immenso. Ci sono due tour differenti (mattina o pomeriggio) che consentono di passeggiare da una stanza all'altra ammirando arredi sfarzosi nei luoghi dove hanno vissuto diverse dinastie di imperatori. Nulla da invidiare, per quanto riguarda gli interni (non ci sono giardini paragonabili a Versailles, Shonbrunn o Caserta) ad altre famose residenze reali.",50,,

Date of experience: November 2019,Incredible Visit - but little is orginial,"I didn't give myself a great deal of time to experience this as I got there 90-minutes before closing. I decided to tour the main part of the museum and it was worth it just to see the incredible hall which is the first thing you walk into. I used the free audio guide and learned that most of the items were not originals as a result of heavy bombing during World War II. For that reason, I wish I would have skipped this part and visited the Treasury which houses jewelry and other cool items.

Audio guides are includes in the admission price and are worth using as you tour the Palace. Leave all bags in the cloakroom except for small purses. Apart from the front of house staff where public interaction is needed at a higher level , most of the staff were either grumpy or downright rude to visitors. I observed staff telling guests off for standing too close to doors or windows and my husband was told to leave the area outside the toilets when he was waiting for me.

There was the usual room after room of beautiful interiors, many similar to other palaces I have visited. What made this special is some of the interiors and rooms (such as in the photo) unlike any other rooms I have visited and were interesting both architecturally and artistically. The main reason I gave this attraction only 4 out of 5 stars is that much of the palace is very difficult to navigate if you are mildly disabled (and definitely not wheelchair friendly). Many of the stairways did not have rails to hold on to, and when you use a cane, and have problems with balance, the stairways were more challenging than I would have liked. However, even with these limitations, if you are up to the challenge, this palace is well worth your time.",40,"Ashland, Oregon",

Date of experience: November 2019,The Height of Opulence,"This Royal Residence was destroyed in WWII to a large extent, but great care has been taken to restore the many rooms and decorations to their previous glory, with great success. An audioguide in English is included free with the entry fee, but you'd have to know this as no one tells you when you pay. We found it helpful, and that it added to the interest of the visit considerably. I took my folding walking stick seat, and I was very glad to have it as there are long stretches with nowhere to sit down. There are also many seats, but the Residence is very large, and the complete tour took us all afternoon. We fitted in a visit to the Treasury in the last half hour it was open, and I would recommend that, as there are some beautiful things, beautifully presented in there.  After a while I began to feel the wealth and extravagance of the decor and furnishings just got a bit too much, and on reflection, I think the short tour might have been a better idea.

Date of experience: September 2019,Viele Räume zu besichtigen,Insgesamt sind wären des Besuches sehr viele Räume zu besichtigen. Durch die zur Zeit laufenden Renovierungen scheint es aber ein wenig chaotisch bei der Raumführung zu sein. Es gab eher provisorische Hinweisschilder und selbst gemalte Schilder. Auch musste man Räume mehrfach durchlaufen um wieder weiter zu gehen zu können. Dies hat das Erlebnis stark getrübt. Manche Erklärungen waren genau auf der anderen Seite des Raumes angebracht und somit verstärkte sich der Eindruck eine Provisorium. Auch macht die Residenz nicht genug aus ihren Möglichkeiten. Zu viele Räume sind nicht ganz wieder hergestellt und mit einzelnen Möbeln ausgestattet. Es entsteht der Eindruck es geht mehr um die Anzahl als um die Qualität. Die wirkliche Highlights sind herausragend aber gehen auch etwas unter. Vielleicht wäre nie neue Überarbeitung mal ein Thema?

The rest of the structure was almost bombed flat during WWII (like much of Munich).

This is particularly true since most the of rooms are empty or partially furnished with items that were not there originally.

It would be even better if it was a bit brighter as there was only nature night from the window. I don’t know whether they ever had lights on. My favourites were the Antiquarium, King’s Tract, Ornate Rooms, Green Gallery, Stone Rooms and Ancestral Gallery.

We'd spent 3 hours there when we stumbled across another part when we assumed we were heading to the exit. Busy but not overcrowded and well worth getting the audio guide and arrows around the place at least giving some sort of direction in which best way to see all.

Музей Резиденции - собственно, сама Резиденция Виттельсбахов, королевские покои (герцогов, курфюрстов и, еаконец, королей). Самое интересное находится в начале осмотра - длинный (66 м) Ренессансный зал Антиквариум и галерея предков (длинный коридор с портретами представителей династии). В середине коридора слева - генеалогическое древо (Виттельсбахи вели счет своей династии от Геркулеса), справа - портреты отцов - основателей, прежде всего, конечно же, Карла Великого. Дальше будет очень много роскошных покоев...Каменные комнаты, Папские комнаты, Трирские комнаты...есть маршруты покороче и подлиннее...всего очень много и очень подробно...По хорошему, парой часов тут не обойтись...Но, повторяю, самое интересное в начале осмотра...Сокровищница: достаточно 1 часа для осмотра. Театр Кювилье: честно говоря, я его дольше искала, чем осматривала. Просто небольшой театр...да, очень красивый зал.

Date of experience: July 2019,Interesting ,"The interiors are beautiful and the history very interesting. We didn’t book a tour and whilst you may learn more doing so, really don’t need to. The entrance is easily found a short distance from Odeonsplatz and audio guides are provided. NOTE: ruck sacks etc are not allowed here and have to be left on pegs. We purchased the multi-ticket which includes the resident itself, treasury and theatre. This is good value although children / teens may start to get bored. The treasury was a pleasant surprise in terms of content and information and was well worth adding to the ticket. The only negative is as other reviews mention the directions are confusing in some areas but that doesn’t spoil the visitor experience. Before or after the visit you can also view the field marshals’ hall.",50,"Suffolk, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled with family

There are a selection of arrows directing you around but I found these to be confusing and not as easy to use as I had hoped often doubling back on myself.  Once in the area of porcelain collection things were even more confusing. It was difficult to find the way out. There is a free brochure showing the floor plan with numbered rooms, but I couldn't find these numbers displayed anywhere in the actual rooms.

Date of experience: June 2019,A must see when in Munich,"For the uninitiated it does not look remarkable from outside, just another historic building among many in Munich city centre. Even as an ex-Münchner I always thought it was 'just another museum'... until you get in. Turns out this place, which is only few minutes away from Marienplatz, the name is kind of deceptive, as it is actually a palace. The complex is huge, the interior is decorated spectacularly, so much that half way through you will wonder where it ends.And do not refer to the pictures here, they are so not reflecting the grandiosity. Hint: An audio guide which supports mutliple languages is provided free but must be collected at the counter which is coming from the cashier is opposite to the direction of the entrance/wardrobe.At the same place there is also the ""Schatzkammer"" (Treasure room) and a combi ticket can be purchased.

Date of experience: July 2019,spectacular restoration with relics (photos allowed!),"Among the top palaces we've seen, this one has a few distinguishing features that make it stand out, including relics, extensive audio in several languages, and permission to take photos (no flash).TIP:  If you are planning on visiting 3 or more castles/palaces in Germany, consider buying the 14 day Mehrtagesticket that allows you to get into 40+ castles/palaces (26 Euros for one adult or 46 Euros for a family).Of the 2 dozen castles/palaces I have visited, the Residenz has possibly the best interior with 90+ furnished rooms full of history as far back as the 1300's, with many aspects having been restored or rebuilt after WWII. Among the many rooms, one displays holy relics (i.e., bones of saints--not for the faint of heart, so skip this room if you don't want to see them). There is an English audio guide that explains many important rooms, or you can just read the panels and accelerate your pace--the best version of a guided tour short of a personal one-on-one guide.  There are seats every few rooms that allows the visitor to rest their tired feet a bit before continuing. We took numerous photos throughout the castle, something that is not allowed at many other sites. We spent more than an hour here before we had to leave for another already-scheduled tour, but this place is worth a lot of time, and has more rooms on display than most sites.",50,"Buena Park, California",Trip type: Traveled with family

We dedicated two hours and saw many of the best parts but did not see it all.  The ticket will provide you a great audio guide.  While some of the court and crown rooms were great along with the green gallery and family portrait gallery, the two best parts were the shell grotto and the Antiquarium.  You won't find anything like this in any other palace.  Now living on the Gulf Coast and a collector of shells, I was impressed by the shell grotto and loved it.  However, the best room was the great diagonal hall with a gorgeous painted ceiling and statues from antiquity representing nearly every Roman Caesar.

The display is very different but equally unique and priceless work spanning several centuries.The Residence covers a large area and houses a wide range of beautifully decorated rooms, each unique in nature.One of my favourite areas was the Grotto Courtyard.The workmanship and artistry contained in this place is incredible; no more so than in the Antiquarium, Ancestral Gallery, Nibelungen Halls and Steinzimmer.

Date of experience: May 2019,Largest City Palace In Germany,"The Residence is located in central Munich just a few short blocks walking distance from the Marienplatz.  It is the former royal palace of the Wittelsbach monarchs of Bavaria and is the largest city palace in Germany.  It served as the seat of government and residence of the Bavarian kings, dukes, and electors for 410 years (1508-1918).  Throughout the palace are exquisitely decorated rooms – furniture and paintings, tapestries, treasures, porcelain and religious devotional items.  Climbing the Imperial Staircase you enter the Imperial Hall, the oldest and largest room in the Residence at 217 feet long.  It houses a collection of antique sculptures and busts, hence the name ""Antiquarium"".  The various State rooms are themselves works of art with richly decorated, walls, ceilings and floors and filled with expensive furniture and tapestries.  The richly gilded gold walls and ceiling of the Ancestral Gallery contain paintings showing the extensive ancestral history of the Elector family tree and was used to justify selection to the thrown of the Holy Roman Empire.  Within the Residence is the Wittelsbachs’ collection of Far Eastern art and over 500 pieces of East Asian porcelain and lacquered items.  There is also an extensive collection of religious relics and liturgical pieces (chalices, crucifixes, etc.).  Within the Treasury, housed in a secure section of the Residence, are the crown jewels of Bavaria as well as a vast collection of jewels, royal insignia, goldsmith's work, jeweled chests, enamels, crystal objects and ivories that have been collected over the centuries by the rulers of Bavaria. At the end of the 18th century, the Bavarian prince also received the entire Palatine treasure and in the 19th century other treasures were added as a result of the secularization of many churches and monasteries.  Of note is the St George's reliquary and the Augsburg silver clock.  The Residence is open from 9 AM to 6 PM April through 15 October and until 5 PM 16 October to March.  Tours are self-guided with free audio-guide included in the price of admission.  Admission to either the Residence or the Treasury is 7 euro, 6 euro reduced rate or a combination ticket to both is 11 euro, 9 euro reduced rate.",50,"Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Servizio di consegna borse è impeccabile e attentissimo, personale molto cordiale e audioguide molto interessanti.L'unica pecca è che per trovare i famosi affreschi che rappresentano la saga dei Nibelunghi è stata un'impresa e nemmeno le spiegazioni di un custode ci sono servite (la mappa non spiega molto bene i su e giù per le scale necessari per arrivare).

Date of experience: March 2019,Portare tempo e scarpe comode,"Martina Corvaglia, 18 anni, Liceo Linguistico Rita Levi-Montalcini, Casarano (LE)Sono stata a Monaco per cinque giorni con la mia classe e durante il viaggio abbiamo visitato il palazzo reale, uno dei più grandi e più belli di tutta Europa. La Residenz si trova nel centro della città, è facile da raggiungere ed è sicuramente uno di quei posti da visitare obbligatoriamente. Con le sue 130 stanze aperte al pubblico, la Residenz si rivela essere un palazzo imponente, maestoso e davvero sfarzoso all’interno, questo ci fa capire infatti la potenza e la grande influenza della famiglia reale, i Wittelsbach che regnarono per tantissimi secoli. Vi è un susseguirsi di stanze piene di mobili antichi e tappezzeria elegante, tante opere d’arte affrescano le meravigliose pareti, decorate anch’esse in oro. La sfarzosità del palazzo, però, non termina solo nelle varie stanze in cui si svolgeva sia la vita pubblica che la vita privata della famiglia reale, ma continua anche nelle sale in cui sono esposte le collezioni di ceramica e quella dei gioielli dei regnanti. La camera del tesoro, infatti, ospita una delle raccolte più preziose al mondo e deve essere visitata assolutamente. Il palazzo è grandissimo, ma purtroppo non abbiamo avuto la possibilità di visitare tutte le sale e neanche l’esterno per una questione di tempi e anche perché non tutte le stanze sono gratuite, ciò nonostante vi è la possibilità di acquistare un biglietto che include tutto. Dunque, è necessario molto tempo da dedicare per visitarne una gran parte e per scoprire le meraviglie nascoste all’ interno e i bellissimi giardini esterni. La visita è molto piacevole e per nulla noiosa grazie agli audioguida che spiegano in tutte le lingue la storia del palazzo e descrivono ogni stanza in maniera accurata, dando spazio anche a delle interessanti curiosità. Consiglio a tutti di visitarla, poiché ne vale veramente la pena, è un edificio meraviglioso che ti lascia a bocca aperta per la sua sontuosità. Inoltre, il prezzo non è eccessivo.Sicuramente una delle cose più belle da vedere a Monaco.",50,,Trip type: Traveled with friends

Date of experience: May 2019,Takes 3 hours to visit the Residence Museum and Treasury,"The combo ticket for the Residence Museum and Treasury is only 9 E for seniors. We spent 1 hour in the Treasury and 2 hours viewing the many rooms in the palace - good value for the money spent. At the end of our morning visit, we were overwhelmed by the palace decor. Enter the museum from the Max Joseph Platz. About mid-way along the palace is a doorway - go through that, past a small courtyard to the ticket office. The audio desk provides free audioguides for both the Treasury and the Residence rooms. We began with the Treasury and when finished, the clerk at the audio desk re-programmed our audioguide for the Residence rooms. We found that the Treasury had items labelled in both German and English with shorter descriptions of the objects than that given on the audioguide. Definitely need the audioguide, however, for explanations of the purpose of the palace rooms and their decor. WC are located just to the right of the entry into the Treasury room - a long flight of stairs, though, up to the free WC. Another WC is behind the door marked 00 in the Grotto. WC are not marked on the layout map.We used 1 hour to see the Treasury with more time spent in Rooms 1 to 5 than in Rooms 6-10. The first 5 rooms held the Wittelbach collection of jewels, royal regalia, reliquaries while the next 4 rooms held glassware, dinnerware, and most notable a silver replica of Trajean's column. In rooms 1-5 I enjoyed looking at the 13th, 14th century crowns from Kunigundi and a spikey crown of an English Queen - all lovely with intricate gold work and blue, amethyst, and pearl settings. The small hand sized pearl studded prayer book looked well used, but the jewel studded St. George killing the dragon was dazzling - get up close and walk around the display case to see all of the detail and the thousands of precious stones embedded in the work. Room 4 was less interesting with religious monstrances but the reason behind the king having portable altars (bejewelled and gilted) was interesting when explained. In Room 5 was the crown for King and Queen during their coronation after 1800 - neither were worn, just held/placed at their feet. It was interesting to see that these 10 rooms were located in a secured area with an entry door similar to that used by banks to secure their customers safety boxes.We used 2 hours to visit the 90 rooms in the palace. Take the layout map for these rooms available at the entrance should you wish to know where in the palace you are. There are red arrows showing visitors the way to follow so no fear of getting lost. Photos can be taken and visitors walk around unguided.  Each room has an information board with a red number that is then typed into the audioguide to hear the commentary about the room. Should the commentary be overly long with its explanation, especially when it references the artists who contributed to the decor in the room, just press the ""Cancel"" button. Or sit on a stool in the rooms to listen to the commentary. Walking through the rooms, I think it becomes obvious where Ludwig II got the idea for his over the top gilded rooms in his Linderhof Palace. There are countless rooms, galleries, and corridors to walk through in this palace as various Wittelbach rulers extended the palace buildings. There was a change in decor with the later rulers in the 1800's but the other rooms all looked similar in their use of gilded ceiling moldings, gilded door panels, gilded table legs, and the use of luxurious fabrics. Where ceiling frescoes had been re-done after the WWII damage they lacked the vibrancy of original paintings seen in other palaces. Certainly some areas were outstanding such as the Grotto (rather grotesque actually), Ancestral Gallery, the Antiquarium Room with many sculptures of notable Romans (caesars) and 2 credenzas with majolica porcelain, private chapels with either gild and blue decor or the Romanesque brick 2 story hall (Court Church of all Saints), and the red porcelain cabinet room with mirrors. There were too many audience rooms and reception/waiting rooms. All of the palace rooms seemed to be for adults; I wondered how royal children entertained themselves or what type of rooms they had.This palace was the main attraction for me in the old town of Munich and was certainly worth the time and good value for the money spent.",50,"Vancouver, Canada",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: May 2019,Residenz: sfarzosa e impegnativa.,"La Residenza dei sovrani Bavaresi di un tempo, ubicata a breve distanza da Marienplatz,é un palazzo reale di rara ricchezza e bellezza. All'esterno ha un aspetto austero ma all'interno é una vera sorpresa.Le 130 stanze aperte al pubblico,il teatro e la Chiesa di Corte (ora sala concerti),sono un susseguirsi di splendore e maestosità.Tuttavia la visita completa richiede almeno 3 ore e per alcuni potrebbe risultare impegnativa e,nel peggiore dei casi,stancante. Per tale motivo reputo inutile usare per tutto il percorso un'audioguida,in quanto é mera utopia pensare di poter ricordare la spiegazione di cosí tanti ambienti.É molto piú rilassante documentarsi prima, per capire cosa si va a  vedere,piuttosto che restare piantati ore ad ascoltare descrizioni di ogni singolo angolo.La sala piú bella é l'Antiquarium,un meraviglioso salone con la volta a botte affrescata e con stupende decorazioni. Ibiglietti si possono acquistare solo in loco e io non ho trovato fila,benché mi sia recata durante le vacanze di Pasqua.

Date of experience: April 2019,Beautiful Palace,"We visited a lot of palaces on our trip to Austria and Germany but Munich Residenz was the best one we went to. Why? Because you tour what seems like every room in the palace!  Most palaces let you see only a handful of rooms.  We were in there for over three hours!  We must’ve picked the right day and time because we only saw one tour group and it was just the three of us in most of the rooms along with the staff.  This palace was nice.  A lot of the original items were destroyed in the bombings during WW2.  So, what you see are restored items or items that came from other palaces. We found the audio tour useless. It gives you too much information.  If you were to listen to every detail, you’d be in the palace over four hours or more.

Date of experience: April 2019,Not flexible,"Other than the antiquarium, the rest of the exhibits / rooms weren't really impressive. They are more the same as each other and some rooms had missing items here and there. The residenz is huge and they have directional arrows to indicate which way you should walk. However there are parts where it is split into two directions. However be aware that once you choose a path, you would not be allowed to reverse. I think this is a good plan if the place is packed with visitors to allow a smooth transition from room to room, but on a day when there is minimum visitors, flexibility or common sense should be used. They basically have one attendant at every corner to enforce the above rule however my wife dropped her cardigan that was hanging off her bag at one area but when we return, it was gone. We asked the attendant and he told us he did not see anything and to go to the baggage storage area where we were also told no one returned it. I find it incredible that there was an attendant in almost every corner yet no one saw a dropped cardigan.

Date of experience: April 2019,"A ""Must-Visit"" while in Munich","Of course!  You have to visit the Munich Residence (the largest city palace in Germany) while in the city. It's located almost in the Marienplatz, so it's very easy to include in your visit.Remember that there are now four parts to your visit:  The Residence Museum, The Treasury, The Cuvilles Theatre and now the Royal Palace.  All are within the same complex and begin at the ticket office, but entrances are in various parts of the interior.Give yourself two hours minimum and easily 3-4 hours if you're really interested in the history offered via free audio guide and posted descriptions.The Residence was used from 1623 through 1918 and The Royal Palace was added and used beginning in 1825. You enter the Royal Palace from room 71, first upper floor,  after you've gone into the Residence, and then wind your way around and exit the same way to continue your tour of the Residence.It's easy to miss the Treasury's entrance, so be watchful about that.Each of the four sites are different and absolutely deserve a visit.

Date of experience: June 2018,"June 2018: Diamonds, statues, paintings, & decorative arts - room after room; Must see!  practical tips for visiting","The Residenz  was a palace for the Wittelsbach dynasty.  Now, it is a modern museum.   Bombing destroyed almost all of the original building during World War 2 (Munich was the birthplace of the Nazi movement, and was an Allied target for that reason).  What you experience when you visit is a recreation of the palace; filled with paintings, tapestries, jewels, clocks, and other decorative arts.   The collection’s scope is amazing and a must-see.  The recreation includes the Cuvillies theater, a beautiful Rococo masterpiece (clearly modeled after the theater at Versailles, but more intimate and – for the tourist – far more accessible).  The Cuvillies theater’s interior is one of the few remaining original parts of the palace.  Before bombs destroyed the palace, caretakers disassembled the interior, and stored it out of harm’s way.  The one other original part of the palace to survive is the antiquarium – a renaissance hall filled with statuary and paintings.   The antiquarium alone is worth the visit.How much time: it’ll take at least four hours, easily, and you may have time to walk through all the rooms, but not enough to immerse yourself in the exhibits.   One could spend the whole day – maybe two – to see everything.Tickets: you can buy tickets for the residenz or the theater, or both.   Do both.   The best ticket is the Mehrtagesticket – 44 Euros – for two adults for 14 days to visit all the Bavarian state museums and gardens.  It will get you into the museum and theater.   Kids 18 and under are free.Getting there: don’t drive.  Use buses or the underground.   The closest underground stop is Odeonsplatz. Alternatively, you could hop off the U at Marienplatz, see the Rathaus and the animatronic clock, then walk to the Residenz (or vice-versa).  Buses are also easy to use.  Alternatively, you could rent a bike.  There’s a huge bike rack in the Max Joseph Platz.  Note: bikes are big in Munich – they’re everywhere.  Strangely, Germans, for the most part, don’t seem to wear bike helmets.  If renting a bike, I’d sure get a helmet.  There’s a lot of automotive traffic on the streets and lots of pedestrians in the pedestrian malls; all making for potential spills that could ruin a trip in a moment.Who will enjoy:  Adults and teens who can appreciate history and/or art will enjoy the visit.  Anyone younger than 13 will likely endure the visit, but with not that much humor.Staff:  they speak enough English, for the most part, to help you get by.  As always knowing some German is not only polite and greatly appreciated, but also an excellent way to truly enjoy your visit.Food: you can find something to eat at a couple wine bars on Residenzstrasse, or other restaurants nearby, but not in the museum.  If you want water, like the rest of Germany, you need to pack your own.   Water fountains seem to be an American thing.  You can refill your water bottle in the WC.Entrances:  there are two that count – from the Residenztrasse and Max-Joseph-Platz.  The platz entrance is the easier to use. These are the only two entrances that get you to the ticket desk.  Go here first, then go to the other entrances to see courtyards and the theater.Selfie sticks:  leave them at home.  They’re verboten!!  And, the staff is obsessed with keeping them out of the museum.Prepping for the weather: even in June, it can get cold and you can get soaked with rain.  Our day in Munich was rainy and mostly in the fifties to sixties.  We had umbrellas, (courtesy of our hotel) and they were worth the trouble of carrying as otherwise we’d have been soaked.  Make sure you pack a sweater, at least, and, to be well prepared, a water resistant wind-breaker.",40,"San Francisco, California",

The first buildings at this site were erected in 1385.  The Treasury houses the riches of the Wittelsbach family that ranges in time from the early Middle Ages to the Neo-classical period.  It includes the crown of the English Princess Blanche (Blanche of Lancaster), the oldest known surviving crown of England.  When she married into the Wittelsbach family it became their property as part of her dowry.  It is also known as the Bohemian Crown or the Palatine Crown; it is thought to have been made after about 1370 and is the best surviving example of Gothic goldsmithing.
