Date of experience: August 2019,Amazing open space in central Munich,"Central Park is all well and good if you live in NYC, but there are several features of Munich's massive city center park that NY will never touch:>>>>Three of Munich's best Bier Gartens -- including the three largest in the worldAcres and acres of mown grass on which to play frisbee or watch the water flow past on a beautiful day.>>>>>A ""surfing buch"" artificial surfing place built into one of the canals through the park.   Get close up views of some very impressive surfers.>>>>A large field where nudism is allowed and even protected, though not from hordes of gaping tourists (and amazingly invasive picture takers.)  Avoid the gawkers by going to the center or take a turn shocking them on the periphery.>>>>A herd of sheep (if you go far enough away from downtown).  Grass guzzling animals are a whole lot cheaper than gas guzzling mowers>>>>A ""Chinese"" tower and a ""Greek Temple"" >>>>Pedalcabs that while whisk you through the highlights for a fistful of EurosRolling ice cream vendors (OK, Central Park has those too, but the ice cream seems to taste better here.)----->>>>  Safety note.  The English Garden is safer than Central Park at almost any time of day.   The southern (downtown side) is generally safe at night, but the upper reaches of the park can be dicey after dark.

Yes, there are a few attractions that you can walk to from the city center at the southern edge of the park. However, the original purpose was to give harried city dwellers a place to decompress.

Definitely recommend seeing eisbach - a unique area of the manmade river in the park where local surfers come to surf the waves on the river (yes waves). It takes about 30 minutes to walk to the other side of the park so it could easily take 1.5 hours to walk the park in a circle as there are so many lovely paths.If you don't fancy walking for that long, you can rent a bike or use one of the electric scooters scattered around the paths via an app by Companies such as  Lime, Jump (Uber), Bird or Tier.

There are wide expanses of lawn, plenty of places to sit and people watch and also places where you can buy coffee, alcohol or lunch.The Chinese pagoda seems so out of place to me, but there were plenty of others who seemed to enjoy their visit. The surfers along the canal are definitely worth watching. They have an organised approach to surfing the wave....lots of fun to be had, and noticeable camaraderie amongst surfers and bystanders. It's not Bells Beach but certainly popular.  Bike riding through the gardens makes everything more easily accessible if you have limited time but if you're on foot and have time to spare, spreading your visit over two days  makes for a relaxing and entertaining time.",50,"Melbourne, Australia",

Date of experience: August 2019,A narrow but very long park. And very interesting experience of visiting it.,"Literally a huge sausage along the Isar River. A couple of creeks also pass through the park, which pass through a pond at the Chinese Tower and end at a small waterfall, which is used by local surfers.My wife and I went around only 1/5 of the park, but even so we got an interesting impression. First, we met several groups of people swimming in a creek. Then we were very surprised to see an enormous number of people resting in open green areas with picnics. People with picnics also come out at our local park on weekends, but I have never seen so many people like here. Then we went to the Chinese Tower, which had food service stalls, fenced with a pass system and many tables at which people ate. Near the tower was a restaurant with beautiful architecture. Then, when we went further, we once again saw an open area with a large number of vacationers, and another bathing place. This time there were stones with a small waterfall from which they coped on rubber rings. At the end of the park, on a small island, there was a Japanese tea house, which we didn't get in because of the long waiting line. And on the other side there was a place fiercely chosen by surfers and their fans, since there they could ride on a stream of water emerging in the creek. Very interesting park and experience visiting it. I think on another day it would be deserted, so if you visit it, I highly recommend doing it on a day off or some holiday.",40,"Tel Aviv, Israel",

Date of experience: August 2019,Terrific open space for all within Munich to share.,"A well maintained and wide ranging open space, with great areas to walk, cycle, stop to drink and eat, including in particular, the Chinese Tower beer garden location.Beware though, alongside some parts of the river, some of the local residents have a propensity to expose themselves, quite literally, by way of an area for nudity! Not really worth looking at to be honest, but be prepared, as you will need to check-in as you move along.Close to the city centre and within easy walking distance, so somewhere well worth visiting.",40,"Devizes, United Kingdom",
Date of experience: September 2019,English Garden year round ,"The English Garden is a little bit of heaven right in the middle of a city of 1.5 million.  I think it is part of what makes Munich feel more like a village.  You see such a mix of residents, tourists, old and young enjoying the park.  There are enough hidden places to feel you have nature all to yourself, or crowded spots to simply sit down and do excellent people watching.  There are the big things that are not to be missed;  surfers on the outer edge of the park, the bridge with the backdrop of lovely small waterfalls, the Chinese turn.  If you can rent a bike to go through, this is the ideal.  Also, every season has something unique to enjoy.  If you are lucky enough to catch it after a snow, bundle up and dive in.  It is breathtaking.",50,,Trip type: Traveled with family

Great balance of shade and sun for different weather patters.Great spot on a really hot day as there are heaps of spots by the streams to either dunk in or float, a popular pass time for locals either on small inflatables or just lying on their backs. As large as it is, you never feel crammed, even on weekend sunny days.Also so many spots for sports and other activities on the many lawns. Beer gardens are either within the park or right by it, making it easy to have a typical German experience.Not as many washrooms without having to walk further and not really any water fountains. Tough for longer runs in hot weather, though there are kiosks for buying water (not ideal though).If you're lucky you may see a true local on a warm summers day strolling naked after a good float on the stream.",50,"Munich, Germany",

Date of experience: July 2019,Awesome lush green haven in the middle of the city,"We were completely bowled over by this lush green spot smack in the middle of Munich. Actually an entire day is required to do full justice to this amazing place. We were not prepared for such a vast expanse of green and therefore had to do a quick run of the place. The garden has it's own river, Eisbach, 2km long, which is man made. Being a really hot day we could see quite a few swimmers merrily floating past. There's even a delightful surfing spot where many surfers could be seen eagerly awaiting their turn. The place has nearly 80 km of walkways and a lake too. The beer garden (within the English garden) with a seating capacity of 7000 is another must visit spot for a 1ltr special mug. One can also try the three wheeler rickshaw ride in the garden if you would rather prefer a laid back look around. I could go on and on. But let me wind up by saying that it took me completely by surprise as it's a totally 'wow' place. If you're on holiday in Munich, especially first time, make sure you do not miss this 'must visit' spot.Cheers,Raghu & Deepa",50,"Kochi (Cochin), India",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: August 2019,Best park,Loved this place too much. It was a boiling hot day and we enjoyed a nice walk up to the beer garden. Good value for money. Enjoyed a litre Stein of beer each and Bratwurst sausages. Took a nice walk back along the river. There is a nudist bit we walked into by mistake but its no dramas. Its how the Germans role.,50,"Rainham, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled as a couple
Date of experience: July 2019,The best spot for a hot day,"If you like parks, if you like beer, and if you like to swim, this is your place to be. Unless the weather is foul. Take a stroll, sit on the grass or watch the surfers practise by the Haus der Kunst. But the best thing to do is taking a bath in the channel, allowing the current to take you down. Don't forget to stop in the beer garden for a meal and refreshment in the shape of a Ma√ü, a 1 litre beer. Prices can scare you, but the place is super cool! Probably the best thing to do in Munich, bar the cultural and historical entertainment.",50,"Ripoll, Spain",Trip type: Traveled with friends

Date of experience: July 2019,Massive beautiful park,"This is by far the biggest park I've ever seen.  But my husband and I had nothing planned for the day so we enjoyed spending the day walking around.  It is beautifully maintained and very clean.  There are lots of wide open spaces to picnic or throw frisbees, and a beautiful river that flows through the park.  If you know where the river is, it can help you from getting lost!  We walked to the Chinese Tower Beer Garden (which was quite a ways in) and ate some super-delicious potatoes. We did see some naked men sunbathing but they were way off the path so it wasn't like you had to walk right by them.  At the beginning of the river, there are a group of surfers and that was fun to watch for a little bit. It was a fun and relaxing day in the English Garden.",50,"Mason, Ohio",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: April 2019,Garden party,"Regarded as one of Munich's must-see stops, I'll admit the Englischer Garten wasn't actually all that high on my priority list. I'm not the most 'at one' with nature, but still felt I had to at very least take a look at this lush area of greenery in the heart of a very modern city, so early one morning off I set. The gardens are fairly sizable, and while for the most part it is grassy plains, there are also plenty of trees as well as numerous small ponds and streams, which ensure it has a large collective of birds running wild to admire. The remarkably large expanse the gardens cover, coupled with my early morning timeframe for visit meant it was a favourite with dog walkers, but I can imagine on a sunny day it will attract more than its fair share of families and picnics. On top of this, the garden does boast more than natural beauty, of which make no mistake it has plenty. Scattered throughout are a variety of minor attractions ranging from a greek style pantheon style monument to the more famous Japanese pagoda, which boasts a small beer garden which infuriatingly I was too early to take advantage of. Likewise there was nobody taking advantage of the artificial wave created with is a popular inner-city surfing spot. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed my jaunt through the Englischer Garten. Yes it isn't my normal cup of tea, but for an early morning stroll it cleared the cobwebs nicely, and for those more in tune with nature it is genuinely lovely. I imagine visiting in the afternoon would be better to be able to take in a beer, but at the same time have my reservations about how busy it would be. In short, I'd recommend taking a stroll through it if you find yourself in Munich, its free and hard to find fault in, it just isnt' necessarily my type of thing.",40,"Scotland, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled solo

On both shores there were people sunbathing (at least one topless), playing soccer, and picnicking.  Another 100 meters further, there is a small area where numerous surfers wait in line for a chance to ride a wave.  Farther along the river, we came to the Chinese and Beer Gardens.

Date of experience: July 2019,One of the most beautiful parks worldwide,"The English garden is simply awesome. Why? Simple. It starts at the Prinzregentenstrasse at the museum Haus der Kunst with the famous Munich surfers (all year long even at -10 Celsius). Just move north and look to your left any you shall discover a Japanese tea house. Maybe you are lucky and you join a Japanese tea ceremony. Along th e small river further up north in summer you will see a lot of swimmers and people sun bathing. You enter a big grass area and to your right you see on a small hill the Monopteros. Just a bit further and you reach the Chinese Tour Beergarden. On weekends you might enjoy the life music. Now follow always north to the Kleinhesseloher See. A small lake with some little boats and yes your are right another beer garden. Some people think this is it but that is not true at all. Just cross the bridge behind the restaurant over the road and you enter the north part of the garden. The more you head up north the wilder the park gets. Amazing! Truly romantic and if you have the time. Just being a blanket and food and drinks, a book etc. and you will find so many hidden places where you can enjoy privacy in the middle of a buzzling city. You can follow the trails til you leave actually the city. So in principal the Central Park in New York is bigger but actually if you add the wilderness to the park, the English garden is far bigger. Do not miss this experience!",50,"Munich, Germany",Trip type: Traveled with friends

We rented bikes from Mike's down Mike's Big Rentals, Kanalstra√üe 17, which is very close to the entrance of the gardens. They also have tours, but this is not hard.  The guy who rented the bikes was really helpful with a map and directions. There are 4 beer gardens in the park.  First stop was Eisbach Wave to watch the surfers.  From there we went to the Beer Garden at the Chinese Tower.  Early in the ride, it's crowded with walkers, but the best thing about riding is you can get much further into this beautiful park.  We stopped at three of the beer gardens, then looped around and came down by the river on the opposite shore. It was a great day. Drink and bike responsibly and you will have a lot of fun!",50,"Austin, Texas",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: June 2019,Amazing place,"We had a few days in Munich mainly to visit nearby Neuwanstein Castle but on the last day my husband mentioned the Englisch Garten. I had no idea what to expect but was amazed when we arrived. We so enjoyed walking the many trails and being by water (and surfers!), enjoying food pavilions and entertainment with German bands. The only negative which really put me in a bad mood on vacation was the hostile bathroom worker near the Chinese area. I went in quickly and did not see the tip jar -it was crowded and I waited too long. Coming out of the stall I was trying to wash my hands and a worker cane up to me and started slamming her mop intentionally on my feet in sandals and making comments I could not understand that sounded angry. I ended up dropping part of my paper towel as she had me so rattled and she flipped out. I then glanced and saw the tip jar. It really ruined part of the day for me. I am a generous person, just did not know. Next restroom I visited the worker was at a table with her jar I gave her a lot and life was good again. Shameful behavior by employee though -I was mistreated and did not appreciate this post bunion surgery.",40,neatfreak38,Trip type: Traveled with family

Suffice to say that if you visit Munich in any season other than winter, you must experience the English Garden.You can easily fill half a day here, if not more.  I highly recommend doing it on a bike.  The garden is huge and trying to cover it all on foot can be tiring and time consuming.

If you have small children, there are lots of areas to run around, play games, fly kites, etc.  I would recommend taking a picnic to enjoy in the shade.   Several streams run through the park, and I saw folks swimming in them.   I'd be careful as the streams in some areas were very fast - verging on rivers and cold as they are could be a risk to weak swimmers and youngsters.  Exercise sound judgement, always.  As usual, you won't find any water fountains, so you'll need to pack water bottles.  When we visited, the park seemed relatively crowded for such a large space.  if there's a hint of rain, take along an umbrella or you'll get soaked.  Note that a number of roads bisect the park, so be very careful and cross only at marked intersections. Getting there:  don't drive.   Use buses or a taxi.  It's also walking distance from subway stops.Eating: pack your own, and you can use a table at a biergarten.  Buy something, like a beer, to be polite.  Don't worry - you won't be the only ones. How to visit: I'd recommend seeing it in bits and pieces - on the way to or from - or maybe dedicate a few hours to one end of the park one day, another bit the next.   don't try to do it all in a day - It'd be a wee bit boring, from my perspective.   That said, by all means go.   It's a great relaxing time - in a park.",40,"San Francisco, California",Trip type: Traveled with family

This is very well organised with a large park style seating area and a selection of cabin style places that serve a selection of foods. We had just had breakfast but our friend got an amazing crepe - I think it's traditional Bavarian style cut into small pieces - if you find the place serving it by the Japanese Tower, do try it - it's amazing!We visited at the beginning of October and were in the park on a Sunday and it was quite cold but dry and fairly busy though quick to get food and there was plenty of seating.",50,"Horley, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled with friends

This river is the place to be in summertime and very famous, there are a lot of young people, hanging around in the sun, playing frisbee, playing African drums etc....You will also find the Monopterus, it is an old building on a little hill, nice for taking Fotos. Further on there is a big and famous old beer garden, which is called 'Chinesischer Turm', where sometimes a Bavarian band is playing live music. If you cross the big greenfield near the river (you could ask someone) you will come to a place with a Japanese teahouse and small waterfalls. There is a big famous museum behind 'Haus der Kunst' on Prinzregentenstrasse with very good and known international artists and Gallerys and Exhibitions. There is also a famous bar with excellent cocktails and food on the terrace, called 'goldene Bar'. You'll meet a lot of young Munich People in Nightlife.
