Date of experience: September 2019,Great views of the city,"Couldn't believe how empty it was! felt like we had the whole tower to ourselves (not complaining!). I felt the admission price was fairly reasonable; in line with what we have paid for similar experiences in other cities. What made this one better is that Munich is a low height city, so we could see further all the way around. Also with this tower located in the northwest corner of the city, with late day sun, most of the city is highlighted fairly well; no shots or views looking in to the sun. We didn't eat at the restaurant up here.The ""rock museum"" ; good thing I didn't know of it before I came, otherwise I might have expected something. I came for the views and was not disappointed.",40,"Omaha, Nebraska",
