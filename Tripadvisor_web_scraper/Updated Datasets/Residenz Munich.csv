The endless complex of rooms, corridors, chambers and antechambers had me wondering if when I came out I was going to emerge in Stuttgart.However, I made my way round what I think was most of the rooms that are open to visitors. I think there were about 16 million of them but I lost count part way. There were throne rooms (several) bed rooms (both ceremonial and for sleeping), reception rooms, a chapel, a room housing a collection of bronze statues, a room housing bizarre and unsettling religious relics, a room housing gold rings, two turtle doves and for all I know a partridge in a very royal pear tree. It's all a bit of a blur.While my comments may sound flippant this was part of the joy of visiting this site - and it really was a joy. You could let it all wash over you and just be blown away by the scale and richness of the rooms on display.Eventually I came to the end and noticed that I had done the tour without the benefit of the free audio guides. So I did it again.Occasionally I found myself standing back unable to decide if a room made mostly out of gold was either the most beautiful room I had ever seen or the most hideous. However, the one thing I was always sure about is that I wouldn't like to dust it.If you're in Munich and have a two or three months to kill you really must visit the Residenz. I have never been anywhere like it.",50,Scotland,

It was worth it to get the combined ticket (Residenz, treasury, opera theater) that came with a self-paced audio guide. Allot at least 4 hours to see all three; more if you enjoy digging into every single recording on the audio guide.  Room after room of tremendous royal wealth and pageantry are on display throughout the entire Residenz complex.  The grotto and Antiquarium are definitely the highlights.  There are also several ingeniously designed pieces of furniture in the rooms for the mechanically inclined.  As some have noted, much of the structure has been restored.  However, don't get too hung up over that. You'll be hard pressed to find anything in Europe that doesn't bear the scars of WWII.  What you see on display today includes the most important original pieces of art along with rooms were painstakingly recreated using original pieces saved from the war.  The antiquarium and grotto alone are worth the price of admission, and there is enough grandeur surviving from the restoration to impart a good sense what life must have been like during the time of the kings.",50,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",
