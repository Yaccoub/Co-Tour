Date of experience: December 2019,One of The Highlights of My Trip To Germany!,"This is a small, narrow space squeezed in between some other buildings, but it is packed full of visual splendor and drama! This church was built towards end of the Late Baroque/Rococo era and represents that style at its peak! Not a single spot is without decoration/ornament of some kind, with statues, carvings, and paintings everywhere the eye turns. It's a quick visit, but man does it leave such a powerful impression, it sort of reminds me of the Bradbury Building back where I live in Los Angeles where that's also a narrow space packed with visual eye candy, though this church is about 150 years older (even though it was largely rebuilt after World War 2) and has even more ornamentation to gaze around at! It is absolutely worth a peek inside whenever you're in Munich!",50,"Irvine, California",

Date of experience: December 2019,German Late Baroque masterpiece,"Recently visited Munich and enjoyed seeing several of the beautiful churches around the Old Town including the Late Baroque masterpiece Asamkirche (Asam Church), the works of the Asam Brothers (1733-46). This church very much reminds us of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome.This is a delightful small church located on Sendlinger Straße, interestingly right beside the historic Asam Haus. The facade is lavishly decorated and worth a few minutes to enjoy prior to entering the church. Within, you are treated to a splendour of German Late Baroque with opulent features and intricately design found throughout. There is tremendous use of gilding, stucco figures and rich use of deep colours and texture that make the small nave and altar area feel like you are walking into a piece of art. The ceiling fresco rounds off a much delightful visit to the Asamkirche, which can conveniently be seen in 10-15 minutes given its small size. In the end, this is a real treat if you enjoy Baroque architecture and design. It is well worth making the time to include a visit to Asamkirche during trips to Munich.",50,"Hong Kong, China",

This church was built in the 18th century by 2 brothers, one of whom was stucco and the other a fresco painter. The gentlemen have not been careful with the processing of blinding gold and white in combination with black and dark brown and have this church more or less tried to use their business card. Pay attention to where the confessional spaces are frescoes and paintings on the wall.",50,"Tilburg, The Netherlands",
Date of experience: November 2019,Best Barock Church Ever!,This is absolutely one of the most over the top Barock churches  ever- and absolutely free. Built around 1733 by the Assam brothers Egid Quirin and Cosmas Damian.

Date of experience: October 2019,Splendid baroque,"The last two times we were here the Gitter (barrier) was closed, so we could not get beyond the vestibule. This time it was open, and we were able to get well into the nave. St Johann Nepomuk is a splendid example of South German Baroque, but darker than most Baroque churches because it is a penitential church. Well worth a visit.",50,"Toronto, Canada",
Date of experience: October 2019,Quick stop,"Very beautiful. It is blocked off so you can’t go far beyond just going inside the doors. You have to view the main room through a tall barricade, but it is breath taking! A fun little stop if you are in the area.",40,,Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: August 2019,Remarkable,"Asamkirche is quite a small building, and from the outside is very unassuming church - if you didn't know it was there you could easily pass it by without noticing. Inside however is probably the most amazing interiors I have seen anywhere. So much has been packed into such a small space, it's like walking into a giant jewellery box - the walls seem to shine, and the photographs certainly don't do it justice. If you get the chance, make time to see it for yourself.",50,"Wigan, United Kingdom",

Date of experience: September 2019,Rococo jewel box,"Something like Willie Wonka’s dream of a theatre/church, this is an intriguing visit or a bizarrely kitsch place of worship - or both of course.  For me it is too much. I am a Romanesque man at heart - but there is no denying that the Asam church is a breathtaking monument. I would not like to hold down the role of house silver-polisher.  Take a look in at the West door, it’s free of charge to take a peep and a memorable piece of ecclesiastical eye-candy.",50,"Hampton, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled with family
Date of experience: June 2019,Small baroque church,"Small but interesting baroque church.  St. Johann Nepomuk, better known as the Asamkirche (Asam Church), is a Baroque church built from 1733 to 1746 by the brothers, sculptor Egid Quirin Asam, and painter Cosmas Damian Asam as their private chapel.  Built without an order, for the greater glory of God and for the salvation of the builders.  Due to public pressure, the brothers were made to make the church accessible to the public.

Date of experience: December 2019,German Late Baroque masterpiece,"Recently visited Munich and enjoyed seeing several of the beautiful churches around the Old Town including the Late Baroque masterpiece Asamkirche (Asam Church), the works of the Asam Brothers (1733-46). This church very much reminds us of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome.This is a delightful small church located on Sendlinger Straße, interestingly right beside the historic Asam Haus. The facade is lavishly decorated and worth a few minutes to enjoy prior to entering the church. Within, you are treated to a splendour of German Late Baroque with opulent features and intricately design found throughout. There is tremendous use of gilding, stucco figures and rich use of deep colours and texture that make the small nave and altar area feel like you are walking into a piece of art. The ceiling fresco rounds off a much delightful visit to the Asamkirche, which can conveniently be seen in 10-15 minutes given its small size. In the end, this is a real treat if you enjoy Baroque architecture and design. It is well worth making the time to include a visit to Asamkirche during trips to Munich.",50,"Hong Kong, China",

This church was built in the 18th century by 2 brothers, one of whom was stucco and the other a fresco painter. The gentlemen have not been careful with the processing of blinding gold and white in combination with black and dark brown and have this church more or less tried to use their business card. Pay attention to where the confessional spaces are frescoes and paintings on the wall.",50,"Tilburg, The Netherlands",

Date of experience: December 2018,バロックの装飾が素晴らしい教会,教会は市庁舎などの中心地からは少し離れていますが、歩いて行けます。バロックが好きなら、わざわざ行く価値があります。 建物に入っても、扉に続く数平方メートル程度の空間しか観光客は入れず、聖堂の本体との間には鉄格子があります。このため、鉄格子の手前から装飾を見学することしかできません。間近に行けないため、視力が弱ければメガネをお忘れなく。さらに、夕方に訪れたため、暗いです。写真もブレやすく一苦労です。 こんな困難はありますが、うっとりする装飾と色彩ですので、ぜひ一度行ってください。,50,富士,
