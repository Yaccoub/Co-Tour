Date of experience: October 2019,River surfing in the middle of the city!,Munich is basically landlocked yet there are tons of people surfing on a river at the southern end of the English Garten?!!? Yup. It’s so cool. You could sit there all day and watch these brave souls put in their wetsuits and wait patiently on either side of the huge river wave waiting for their turn. They are so well behaved and they don’t bud the line at all. The best views are from either side of the bank but I’d suggest the southern end (left side of the surfers on the wave) and not the right since you may be blocked by the guys waiting for their turn. Just look at the pics and search this place up on YouTube to get a feel for it but nothing more for me to say on here. It’s well worth a visit if you’re in Munich!!,50,"Toronto, Canada",

Date of experience: June 2019,Inland River Surfing,"As a Floridian, I had to see this, surfing inland in a mountainous region.  However hydrologic forces of water to source the English Garden create a rapid wave that can be surfed.  My son has friend who surfed it about two weeks before we got there.  While the physics of a shore wave and a rapid wave are different, you can surf it.  Our friend says its cold and it is more difficult to keep forward momentum in a rapid.  Still he overcame and enjoyed.  We simply enjoyed watching surfers take turns with many wiping out but some holding their own.  It really is something you need to visit to see.  Unfortunately the main bridge to watch from is currently under construction, so watch from the river banks as we did.",50,"Pensacola, Florida",Trip type: Traveled with family

Date of experience: May 2019,A voir,"A l'une des entrées de l'Englischer Garten, le Central Park local, l'Eisbach (un affluent de l'Isar) forme une boucle artificielle qui génère une vague d'un mètre. Un panneau donne le ton d'entrée de jeu: le canal est étroit et peu profond; il existe un risque non négligeable de se fracasser la tête sur le béton, et les novices sont priés de s'abstenir. Des jeunes gens se succèdent sur la vague, chacun attendant patiemment son tour de se lancer pour quelques virevoltes plus ou moins réussies. Même les cadors qui enchaînent les pirouettes sous les applaudissements des badauds n'abusent pas: assez vite, ils se jettent à l'eau pour remonter sur la berge un peu plus bas et attendre de nouveau leur tour, planche sous le bras. C'est un très chouette spectacle, tout à fait inattendu en ville!",50,"Toulon, France",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Very cool for the viewers and even more cool for the surfers as they crash and burn into the cold water. Great photo and video action.",50,"Ketchum, Idaho",Trip type: Traveled as a couple
