Date of experience: November 2019,...ausser sie surfen selbst,"Naja, als Attraktion eher überbewertet. Sowieso im Moment, wo alles rundherum umgebaut wird. Ein Weilchen zuschauen schadet nix, wenn man in der Gegend ist. Ein paar Könner und ein paar Anfänger beobachten. Aber mehr als 5 Minuten gibt es nicht her, ausser man ist selbst Surfer. Dann muss man es wohl mal selbst ausprobieren.",30,"Winterthur, Switzerland",

Date of experience: November 2018,lovely to see some waves,while covering english garden suddenly you take a pause watching the surfers at this narrow river having huge waves.,40,,
Date of experience: October 2019,River surfing in the middle of the city!,Munich is basically landlocked yet there are tons of people surfing on a river at the southern end of the English Garten?!!? Yup. It’s so cool. You could sit there all day and watch these brave souls put in their wetsuits and wait patiently on either side of the huge river wave waiting for their turn. They are so well behaved and they don’t bud the line at all. The best views are from either side of the bank but I’d suggest the southern end (left side of the surfers on the wave) and not the right since you may be blocked by the guys waiting for their turn. Just look at the pics and search this place up on YouTube to get a feel for it but nothing more for me to say on here. It’s well worth a visit if you’re in Munich!!,50,"Toronto, Canada",

Date of experience: October 2019,A desperate clan of surfers,"There's really no other way to describe this. It's a narrow fast flowing river where they've augmented the bottom to create a standing wave. The rideable section is 10-15m wide so it's limited to single rider. Watching guys simply step onto their board from the bank and start riding is cool - as are some of the wipe-outs. Otherwise, it's a little sad to see them go back and forth in a confined space - a bit like a porpoise or orca in a tank.",30,San Diego,
