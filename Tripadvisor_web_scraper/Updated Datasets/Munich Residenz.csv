Date of experience: December 2019,Not to be missed! ,"Make time for this palace!! It was amazing to see, even with no prior knowledge of the history. Tourist information in Munich really underplays how stunning this place is. And it‚Äôs an easy walk from Marienplatz. My only regret is that we had only reserved a few hours to see it. Plan to spend way too long in line for a ticket, but make sure to get a ticket to see the treasury as well. Some gorgeous crowns, etc there.",50,"Chicago, Illinois",
Date of experience: March 2020,Huge- and quite magnificent!,"So, I got really lost in here. It is huge. If you were to take the long tour and listen to every part of the audio tour I think that you could easily spend the whole day exploring it. The main part of the tour was incredibly interesting, with a large selection of items to few and learn about. If- like me- you enjoy exploring palaces then I can definitely recommend  a visit (however I must admit that Nymphenberg is more Instagram-able).",50,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",

Date of experience: September 2019,Bellissima e interminabile esperienza,"√à un enorme complesso che ha ospitato la casa regnante della Baviera (i Wittelsbach) per diversi secoli. L‚Äôedificio, in realt√†, √® un insieme di edifici frutto degli ampliamenti successivi da parte dei principi che si sono succeduti. Entriamo alle 11:00 sapendo che ci aspetter√† una visita impegnativa; le stanze da visitare sono ben 130. Il costo del biglietto e di 11‚Ç¨ compresa l‚Äôaudioguida in italiano che ci viene consegnata, guarda caso, da una ragazza italiana. Per le foto non ci sono limiti. Cominciamo, cos√¨, il percorso guidato con l‚Äôaiuto dell‚Äôaudioguida. Descrivere nel dettaglio tutta la visita sarebbe un‚Äôoperazione lunga e, pertanto, segnalo le cose pi√π importanti: l‚ÄôAntiquarium, una grande sala affrescata contenente numerosi busti di imperatori romani, la camera del trono, la statua di San Giorgio ricoperta di una infinit√† di diamanti, la camera del tesoro, il Grottenhof con la fontana di Perseo e ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.... mi fermo qui. Ci aiuta molto l‚Äôaudioguida esaustiva e completa. Le ultime trenta stanze, sfiniti e con gli occhi pieni di tesori, le facciamo senza audioguida e a passo pi√π svelto. Consegniamo le audioguide e dopo ben 4 ore di visita, stanchi ma soddisfatti, usciamo dal palazzo. Una esperienza davvero bella, da non perdere assolutamente.",50,,
Date of experience: December 2019,Magnifica,"Abbiamo visitato la residenza  il 30 dicembre con un tour organizzato compiendo la visita con la guida del tour, un po' troppo frettolosa, in circa 1h 30min. Da dire che ci vorrebbe il doppio del tempo, circa 3 ore, per poter visitarla bene e apprezzarne i suoi gioielli. La residenza √® stata per secoli il luogo di residenza e la sede del governo dei duchi, poi dei principi elettori e infine dei re di Baviera. E' enorme, ci sono una moltitudine di stanze, una pi√π bella dell'altra. Che dire di pi√π: se visitate Monaco la visita √® d'obbligo.",50,"Brembate di Sopra, Italy",

Date of experience: March 2020,It's big. Probably bigger than Versailles,"This place is dripping gold. Amazing opulence and architectural beauty. Did I say how BIG it is ?   The only negatives are that it closes quite early in the winter, and it can be hard to actually find the way IN",40,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",
Date of experience: February 2020,Awesome,The Residenz is a very large palace which is a must see. The insides are beautifully decorated with the rooms differently set out and richly ornate. The whole complex is extremely well presented with lavish furniture and beautiful pictures everywhere. Due to the size it does take some time to make the most of it at least 2 to 3 hours but every second is worth it.There is also the Treasury and the Cuvilli√©s Theatre for which there is an extra charge to view. We did the treasury but missed the Cuvilles Theatre but if the main palace is anything to go by it should also be superb.You cannot go to Munich and miss the out the Residenz. It is well worth the investment of your time and effort,50,"Upholland, United Kingdom",
Date of experience: February 2020,Gaste = flabbered,"This place is monumentally huge! There is so much to see it is hard to know where to begin.Actually it was quite easy to know where to begin because a helpful member of staff pointed me in the right direction. But that isn't quite what I mean. What I mean is, it is difficult to know which bit to focus on first when writing about it, as there is so much, so very much.I bought a ticket for the Residenz and the Treasury and made my way in following red signs. I was guided from room to ornate room dripping with paintings, furniture, tapestries and assorted royal blingery any one of which you could write a book about. After a while (and I appreciate how ignorant this makes me sound) it all starts to blur into one and I found myself thinking ""I'm sure I've been in this room before."" The endless complex of rooms, corridors, chambers and antechambers had me wondering if when I came out I was going to emerge in Stuttgart.However, I made my way round what I think was most of the rooms that are open to visitors. I think there were about 16 million of them but I lost count part way. There were throne rooms (several) bed rooms (both ceremonial and for sleeping), reception rooms, a chapel, a room housing a collection of bronze statues, a room housing bizarre and unsettling religious relics, a room housing gold rings, two turtle doves and for all I know a partridge in a very royal pear tree. It's all a bit of a blur.While my comments may sound flippant this was part of the joy of visiting this site - and it really was a joy. You could let it all wash over you and just be blown away by the scale and richness of the rooms on display.Eventually I came to the end and noticed that I had done the tour without the benefit of the free audio guides. So I did it again.Occasionally I found myself standing back unable to decide if a room made mostly out of gold was either the most beautiful room I had ever seen or the most hideous. However, the one thing I was always sure about is that I wouldn't like to dust it.If you're in Munich and have a two or three months to kill you really must visit the Residenz. I have never been anywhere like it.",50,Scotland,

From the outside it‚Äôs unassuming, but interior reveals wealth, history, and a world that has passed.  Much of the building and it‚Äôs contents were destroyed during World War II and has been restored, other items are just empty highlighting what‚Äôs been lost.  I decided to just to the main self guided tour for 9 euros and spend almost 3 hours taking the long route.  The great hall early in is spectacular, many of the room transport you back in time.  I did skip or quickly walk through the endless rooms of table settings and vases instead looking at the art and furniture.   It was a great visit and something I‚Äôd not planned on.

Date of experience: January 2020,Amazing Display of Wealth,"We visited in the winter, so this turned out to be a great indoor activity for a cold, snowy day.  It was worth it to get the combined ticket (Residenz, treasury, opera theater) that came with a self-paced audio guide. Allot at least 4 hours to see all three; more if you enjoy digging into every single recording on the audio guide.  Room after room of tremendous royal wealth and pageantry are on display throughout the entire Residenz complex.  The grotto and Antiquarium are definitely the highlights.  There are also several ingeniously designed pieces of furniture in the rooms for the mechanically inclined.  As some have noted, much of the structure has been restored.  However, don't get too hung up over that. You'll be hard pressed to find anything in Europe that doesn't bear the scars of WWII.  What you see on display today includes the most important original pieces of art along with rooms were painstakingly recreated using original pieces saved from the war.  The antiquarium and grotto alone are worth the price of admission, and there is enough grandeur surviving from the restoration to impart a good sense what life must have been like during the time of the kings.",50,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",
Date of experience: December 2019, Nice but unfortunately not original,"If you are into Baroque, this would be a great place to see. Unfortunately most of it was destroyed in WWII, so what you see is a great reconstruction job (which by the way has been done beautifully), but unfortunately very little of the original palace, it‚Äôs furnishings and art have survived. It is, however, still very nice to see. There are 130+ rooms to see plus the treasury. We only had two hours to spare, so skipped the treasury (you can buy tickets for both together or separately at The Residenz, but not online). Two hours was not enough to do justice to the palace and we had to skip the audio guide too. So I would recommend 3 to 4 hours to do this place justice. Audio guides are available for free with the ticket, but if you are on express visit, you can get by reading fairly well done signage which is in every room in German and English.",40,"Sydney, Australia",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: December 2019,Very Impressive,"We visited the Residenz the day after we visited Nymphenburg Palace, which is a lot of Baroque style to take in in a short amount of time. The palace is beautiful, though as much of Germany was bombed during WWII, much of the Residenz is a replication as opposed to the original building. The building itself is beautiful inside, with ornate paintings, ceilings, furniture, and more.Unless you absolutely love Baroque style, try to schedule this at least 48 hours before or after Nymphenburg Palace, as it feels repetitive if you see them too close together.",50,,
Date of experience: December 2019,"Bello, ma quanto tempo...","Il palazzo ha degli interni effettivamente molto belli e nel prezzo del biglietto √® compresa l'utile audioguida in italiano. Va per√≤ detto che le dimensioni del palazzo e la quantit√† di stanze (alcune molto belle, altre meno interessanti) √® davvero enorme e anche cercando di tagliare vanno messe in conto minimo 3 ore di tempo.

Date of experience: December 2019,Prezzo onesto e visita piacevole ,Considerando che a Monaco non c √® molto da vedere (eccezione per i mercatini di Natale molto carini in diversi punti della citt√†) vale la pena visitare questa residenza. C √® la possibilit√† di scegliere se visitare tutte e tre le parti in cui si divide la visita o scegliere quella che pi√π interessa. Personalmente ho molto apprezzato la residenza in s√® e il teatro.

I decided to tour the main part of the museum and it was worth it just to see the incredible hall which is the first thing you walk into. I used the free audio guide and learned that most of the items were not originals as a result of heavy bombing during World War II.

Apart from the front of house staff where public interaction is needed at a higher level , most of the staff were either grumpy or downright rude to visitors.

Date of experience: November 2019,Amazing,This place is amazing. Must see if you want a glimpse back in time. I did the tour with the audio. You cannot bring backpacks but they have a place to check your bag and coat Make sure you hold onto the audio if you decide to do the residence and the treasury tour.

Date of experience: October 2019,Lovely palace with an interesting history,"I'm not sure what I expected when I decided to visit the Residenz, but I can tell you that it exceeded my expectations. There was the usual room after room of beautiful interiors, many similar to other palaces I have visited. What made this special is some of the interiors and rooms (such as in the photo) unlike any other rooms I have visited and were interesting both architecturally and artistically. The main reason I gave this attraction only 4 out of 5 stars is that much of the palace is very difficult to navigate if you are mildly disabled (and definitely not wheelchair friendly). Many of the stairways did not have rails to hold on to, and when you use a cane, and have problems with balance, the stairways were more challenging than I would have liked. However, even with these limitations, if you are up to the challenge, this palace is well worth your time.",40,"Ashland, Oregon",

Date of experience: November 2019,The Height of Opulence,"This Royal Residence was destroyed in WWII to a large extent, but great care has been taken to restore the many rooms and decorations to their previous glory, with great success. An audioguide in English is included free with the entry fee, but you'd have to know this as no one tells you when you pay. We found it helpful, and that it added to the interest of the visit considerably. I took my folding walking stick seat, and I was very glad to have it as there are long stretches with nowhere to sit down. There are also many seats, but the Residence is very large, and the complete tour took us all afternoon. We fitted in a visit to the Treasury in the last half hour it was open, and I would recommend that, as there are some beautiful things, beautifully presented in there.  After a while I began to feel the wealth and extravagance of the decor and furnishings just got a bit too much, and on reflection, I think the short tour might have been a better idea.  The visit has left a lasting impression, as much for the quality of the restoration as for the building itself.",40,"Stockport, United Kingdom",

Date of experience: September 2019,Viele R√§ume zu besichtigen,Insgesamt sind w√§ren des Besuches sehr viele R√§ume zu besichtigen. Durch die zur Zeit laufenden Renovierungen scheint es aber ein wenig chaotisch bei der Raumf√ºhrung zu sein. Es gab eher provisorische Hinweisschilder und selbst gemalte Schilder. Auch musste man R√§ume mehrfach durchlaufen um wieder weiter zu gehen zu k√∂nnen. Dies hat das Erlebnis stark getr√ºbt. Manche Erkl√§rungen waren genau auf der anderen Seite des Raumes angebracht und somit verst√§rkte sich der Eindruck eine Provisorium. Auch macht die Residenz nicht genug aus ihren M√∂glichkeiten. Zu viele R√§ume sind nicht ganz wieder hergestellt und mit einzelnen M√∂beln ausgestattet. Es entsteht der Eindruck es geht mehr um die Anzahl als um die Qualit√§t. Die wirkliche Highlights sind herausragend aber gehen auch etwas unter. Vielleicht w√§re nie neue √úberarbeitung mal ein Thema?

Date of experience: October 2019,5 stars for Treasury 3 stars for the rest,"The treasury section is small, but very cool with some significant medieval historical context. The rest of the structure was almost bombed flat during WWII (like much of Munich). After the first half-dozen rooms where each description (both text and audio available in English) has a coda of ""reconstructed based on period piece designs..,"" you start getting a bit jaded. This is particularly true since most the of rooms are empty or partially furnished with items that were not there originally. It's a sad commentary on the enormous cultural cost of war that's often ignored behind the cost in lives, economic stability, etc. Take the short tour route and save energy for other attractions.",40,San Diego,

When I walked to the Antiquarium, I was the only visitor except one staff member was there. It was pretty amazing. It would be even better if it was a bit brighter as there was only nature night from the window. I don‚Äôt know whether they ever had lights on. My favourites were the Antiquarium, King‚Äôs Tract, Ornate Rooms, Green Gallery, Stone Rooms and Ancestral Gallery. Going so late also meant I missed the theatre, as I didn't have enough time to see everything.",50,,
Date of experience: September 2019,Spectacular grandeur,I took the combined ticket with the treasury and the CuvilleTheatre. This is a large palace You can spend 3 hrs to go from room to room You need the audio guide to go through as it also covers few centuries of history until the modern It is restored to mint condition. I saw downstairs the most impressive collection of treasury I ever see. The china and porcelain figure dating from the mid 15 century The audio guide explains some of the scene as some of the pieces are quite elaborate The tapestry the display of furniture the Grune Room which was my fav The staff is very helpful Count at least 3 hrs if you include the Theatre You are also very close to shopping area for lunch Highly recommended,50,"Grimsby, Canada",

We did the combined treasury and palace ticket. The treasury was good but that was more exhibits on display where as the palace is/was a living museum, fantastic. So much decedance and it's huge. We'd spent 3 hours there when we stumbled across another part when we assumed we were heading to the exit. Busy but not overcrowded and well worth getting the audio guide and arrows around the place at least giving some sort of direction in which best way to see all. Can't remember now if you're allowed but if so take a bottle of water around with you. It has a good mixture of everything from statues, paintings, tapestries to wholly furnished rooms with good history guides in each room. Highly recommended.

We went a little later in the day so there were not a lot of people which was very  nice since it was warm inside.  However, because we were there later, we were not able to view the Treasury.  If you have a student I.D., take it with you to enjoy a discount.  Worthwhile visit!",40,"Northville, Michigan",

Date of experience: August 2019,Opulenta e monumentale ,"Dalla visita che - preparatevi - vi prender√† almeno 3 ore intensive, risulta evidente il leit motiv dei reggenti bavaresi, la megalomania e l'esercizio spasmodico del potere, reso manifesto dalla maestosit√† di una residenza monachese accresciuta ad ogni nuovo insediamento. Ciascuno ha aggiunto parti sempre pi√π ricche, sino a giungere ad una struttura enorme, quasi dispersiva, bellissima. Vi stancherete al punto che alla visita delle ultime 60 stanze avrete dimenticato le precedenti 60. Se vi lascerete portare dalla guida gratuita in varie lingue, i tempi si allungano vertiginosamente. Ogni stanza prevede una spiegazione di almeno 5 minuti. Potrete visitare il tesoro (da vedere  assolutamente) con un biglietto a parte ed il teatro li vicino (si fa per dire). Potrete acquistare il biglietto complessivo a 13 euro. Sicuramente da fare.",50,,Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: July 2019,Massive building with confusing directions inside,"Right in the centre of Munich this building suffered badly in the Allied Bombing in 1944, but has been faithfully restored and a lot of the artifacts that could be removed were in safe keeping before the bombing and have since been returned. There are a selection of arrows directing you around but I found these to be confusing and not as easy to use as I had hoped often doubling back on myself.  Once in the area of porcelain collection things were even more confusing. It was difficult to find the way out. There is a free brochure showing the floor plan with numbered rooms, but I couldn't find these numbers displayed anywhere in the actual rooms. Had these been prominently displayed it would have made life so much easier for finding my way around.

Date of experience: June 2019,A must see when in Munich,"For the uninitiated it does not look remarkable from outside, just another historic building among many in Munich city centre. Even as an ex-M√ºnchner I always thought it was 'just another museum'... until you get in. Turns out this place, which is only few minutes away from Marienplatz, the name is kind of deceptive, as it is actually a palace. The complex is huge, the interior is decorated spectacularly, so much that half way through you will wonder where it ends.And do not refer to the pictures here, they are so not reflecting the grandiosity. Hint: An audio guide which supports mutliple languages is provided free but must be collected at the counter which is coming from the cashier is opposite to the direction of the entrance/wardrobe.At the same place there is also the ""Schatzkammer"" (Treasure room) and a combi ticket can be purchased.

Date of experience: July 2019,spectacular restoration with relics (photos allowed!),"Among the top palaces we've seen, this one has a few distinguishing features that make it stand out, including relics, extensive audio in several languages, and permission to take photos (no flash).TIP:  If you are planning on visiting 3 or more castles/palaces in Germany, consider buying the 14 day Mehrtagesticket that allows you to get into 40+ castles/palaces (26 Euros for one adult or 46 Euros for a family).Of the 2 dozen castles/palaces I have visited, the Residenz has possibly the best interior with 90+ furnished rooms full of history as far back as the 1300's, with many aspects having been restored or rebuilt after WWII. Among the many rooms, one displays holy relics (i.e., bones of saints--not for the faint of heart, so skip this room if you don't want to see them). There is an English audio guide that explains many important rooms, or you can just read the panels and accelerate your pace--the best version of a guided tour short of a personal one-on-one guide.  There are seats every few rooms that allows the visitor to rest their tired feet a bit before continuing. We took numerous photos throughout the castle, something that is not allowed at many other sites. We spent more than an hour here before we had to leave for another already-scheduled tour, but this place is worth a lot of time, and has more rooms on display than most sites.",50,"Buena Park, California",Trip type: Traveled with family

We dedicated two hours and saw many of the best parts but did not see it all.  The ticket will provide you a great audio guide.  While some of the court and crown rooms were great along with the green gallery and family portrait gallery, the two best parts were the shell grotto and the Antiquarium.  You won't find anything like this in any other palace.  Now living on the Gulf Coast and a collector of shells, I was impressed by the shell grotto and loved it.  However, the best room was the great diagonal hall with a gorgeous painted ceiling and statues from antiquity representing nearly every Roman Caesar. In addition, we bought tickets to the Treasury and theater both those are part of other reviews.For me this was one of the best things we saw in Munich and for that matter Europe.

I would suggest allowing a minimum of 2-3 hours for both the Residenz and treasury; but you could easily spend up to 5 hours as there is just so much to see and learn. Highly recommend.,50,"Perth, Australia",Trip type: Traveled with family

Date of experience: May 2019,Largest City Palace In Germany,"The Residence is located in central Munich just a few short blocks walking distance from the Marienplatz.  It is the former royal palace of the Wittelsbach monarchs of Bavaria and is the largest city palace in Germany.  It served as the seat of government and residence of the Bavarian kings, dukes, and electors for 410 years (1508-1918).  Throughout the palace are exquisitely decorated rooms ‚Äì furniture and paintings, tapestries, treasures, porcelain and religious devotional items.  Climbing the Imperial Staircase you enter the Imperial Hall, the oldest and largest room in the Residence at 217 feet long.  It houses a collection of antique sculptures and busts, hence the name ""Antiquarium"".  The various State rooms are themselves works of art with richly decorated, walls, ceilings and floors and filled with expensive furniture and tapestries.  The richly gilded gold walls and ceiling of the Ancestral Gallery contain paintings showing the extensive ancestral history of the Elector family tree and was used to justify selection to the thrown of the Holy Roman Empire.  Within the Residence is the Wittelsbachs‚Äô collection of Far Eastern art and over 500 pieces of East Asian porcelain and lacquered items.  There is also an extensive collection of religious relics and liturgical pieces (chalices, crucifixes, etc.).  Within the Treasury, housed in a secure section of the Residence, are the crown jewels of Bavaria as well as a vast collection of jewels, royal insignia, goldsmith's work, jeweled chests, enamels, crystal objects and ivories that have been collected over the centuries by the rulers of Bavaria. At the end of the 18th century, the Bavarian prince also received the entire Palatine treasure and in the 19th century other treasures were added as a result of the secularization of many churches and monasteries.  Of note is the St George's reliquary and the Augsburg silver clock.  The Residence is open from 9 AM to 6 PM April through 15 October and until 5 PM 16 October to March.  Tours are self-guided with free audio-guide included in the price of admission.

La Residenz si trova nel centro della citt√†, √® facile da raggiungere ed √® sicuramente uno di quei posti da visitare obbligatoriamente. Con le sue 130 stanze aperte al pubblico, la Residenz si rivela essere un palazzo imponente, maestoso e davvero sfarzoso all‚Äôinterno, questo ci fa capire infatti la potenza e la grande influenza della famiglia reale, i Wittelsbach che regnarono per tantissimi secoli. Vi √® un susseguirsi di stanze piene di mobili antichi e tappezzeria elegante, tante opere d‚Äôarte affrescano le meravigliose pareti, decorate anch‚Äôesse in oro. La sfarzosit√† del palazzo, per√≤, non termina solo nelle varie stanze in cui si svolgeva sia la vita pubblica che la vita privata della famiglia reale, ma continua anche nelle sale in cui sono esposte le collezioni di ceramica e quella dei gioielli dei regnanti. La camera del tesoro, infatti, ospita una delle raccolte pi√π preziose al mondo e deve essere visitata assolutamente. Il palazzo √® grandissimo, ma purtroppo non abbiamo avuto la possibilit√† di visitare tutte le sale e neanche l‚Äôesterno per una questione di tempi e anche perch√© non tutte le stanze sono gratuite, ci√≤ nonostante vi √® la possibilit√† di acquistare un biglietto che include tutto. Dunque, √® necessario molto tempo da dedicare per visitarne una gran parte e per scoprire le meraviglie nascoste all‚Äô interno e i bellissimi giardini esterni. La visita √® molto piacevole e per nulla noiosa grazie agli audioguida che spiegano in tutte le lingue la storia del palazzo e descrivono ogni stanza in maniera accurata, dando spazio anche a delle interessanti curiosit√†. Consiglio a tutti di visitarla, poich√© ne vale veramente la pena, √® un edificio meraviglioso che ti lascia a bocca aperta per la sua sontuosit√†. Inoltre, il prezzo non √® eccessivo.Sicuramente una delle cose pi√π belle da vedere a Monaco.",50,,Trip type: Traveled with friends

Date of experience: May 2019,Takes 3 hours to visit the Residence Museum and Treasury,"The combo ticket for the Residence Museum and Treasury is only 9 E for seniors. We spent 1 hour in the Treasury and 2 hours viewing the many rooms in the palace - good value for the money spent. At the end of our morning visit, we were overwhelmed by the palace decor. Enter the museum from the Max Joseph Platz. About mid-way along the palace is a doorway - go through that, past a small courtyard to the ticket office. The audio desk provides free audioguides for both the Treasury and the Residence rooms. We began with the Treasury and when finished, the clerk at the audio desk re-programmed our audioguide for the Residence rooms. We found that the Treasury had items labelled in both German and English with shorter descriptions of the objects than that given on the audioguide. Definitely need the audioguide, however, for explanations of the purpose of the palace rooms and their decor. WC are located just to the right of the entry into the Treasury room - a long flight of stairs, though, up to the free WC. Another WC is behind the door marked 00 in the Grotto. WC are not marked on the layout map.We used 1 hour to see the Treasury with more time spent in Rooms 1 to 5 than in Rooms 6-10. The first 5 rooms held the Wittelbach collection of jewels, royal regalia, reliquaries while the next 4 rooms held glassware, dinnerware, and most notable a silver replica of Trajean's column. In rooms 1-5 I enjoyed looking at the 13th, 14th century crowns from Kunigundi and a spikey crown of an English Queen - all lovely with intricate gold work and blue, amethyst, and pearl settings. The small hand sized pearl studded prayer book looked well used, but the jewel studded St. George killing the dragon was dazzling - get up close and walk around the display case to see all of the detail and the thousands of precious stones embedded in the work. Room 4 was less interesting with religious monstrances but the reason behind the king having portable altars (bejewelled and gilted) was interesting when explained. In Room 5 was the crown for King and Queen during their coronation after 1800 - neither were worn, just held/placed at their feet. It was interesting to see that these 10 rooms were located in a secured area with an entry door similar to that used by banks to secure their customers safety boxes.We used 2 hours to visit the 90 rooms in the palace. Take the layout map for these rooms available at the entrance should you wish to know where in the palace you are. There are red arrows showing visitors the way to follow so no fear of getting lost. Photos can be taken and visitors walk around unguided.  Each room has an information board with a red number that is then typed into the audioguide to hear the commentary about the room. Should the commentary be overly long with its explanation, especially when it references the artists who contributed to the decor in the room, just press the ""Cancel"" button. Or sit on a stool in the rooms to listen to the commentary. Walking through the rooms, I think it becomes obvious where Ludwig II got the idea for his over the top gilded rooms in his Linderhof Palace. There are countless rooms, galleries, and corridors to walk through in this palace as various Wittelbach rulers extended the palace buildings. There was a change in decor with the later rulers in the 1800's but the other rooms all looked similar in their use of gilded ceiling moldings, gilded door panels, gilded table legs, and the use of luxurious fabrics. Where ceiling frescoes had been re-done after the WWII damage they lacked the vibrancy of original paintings seen in other palaces. Certainly some areas were outstanding such as the Grotto (rather grotesque actually), Ancestral Gallery, the Antiquarium Room with many sculptures of notable Romans (caesars) and 2 credenzas with majolica porcelain, private chapels with either gild and blue decor or the Romanesque brick 2 story hall (Court Church of all Saints), and the red porcelain cabinet room with mirrors. There were too many audience rooms and reception/waiting rooms. All of the palace rooms seemed to be for adults; I wondered how royal children entertained themselves or what type of rooms they had.This palace was the main attraction for me in the old town of Munich and was certainly worth the time and good value for the money spent.",50,"Vancouver, Canada",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: May 2019,Residenz: sfarzosa e impegnativa.,"La Residenza dei sovrani Bavaresi di un tempo, ubicata a breve distanza da Marienplatz,√© un palazzo reale di rara ricchezza e bellezza. All'esterno ha un aspetto austero ma all'interno √© una vera sorpresa.Le 130 stanze aperte al pubblico,il teatro e la Chiesa di Corte (ora sala concerti),sono un susseguirsi di splendore e maestosit√†.Tuttavia la visita completa richiede almeno 3 ore e per alcuni potrebbe risultare impegnativa e,nel peggiore dei casi,stancante. Per tale motivo reputo inutile usare per tutto il percorso un'audioguida,in quanto √© mera utopia pensare di poter ricordare la spiegazione di cos√≠ tanti ambienti.√â molto pi√∫ rilassante documentarsi prima, per capire cosa si va a  vedere,piuttosto che restare piantati ore ad ascoltare descrizioni di ogni singolo angolo.La sala pi√∫ bella √© l'Antiquarium,un meraviglioso salone con la volta a botte affrescata e con stupende decorazioni. Ibiglietti si possono acquistare solo in loco e io non ho trovato fila,bench√© mi sia recata durante le vacanze di Pasqua. I medesimi sono disponibili di diversa tipologia e prezzo; fino ai 18 anni l'ingresso √© gratuito.Camminare nel giardino reale  √© inoltre molto piacevole e l'ingresso √© gratuito,aperto a tutti.",50,Italy,Trip type: Traveled with family

Date of experience: April 2019,Beautiful Palace,"We visited a lot of palaces on our trip to Austria and Germany but Munich Residenz was the best one we went to. Why? Because you tour what seems like every room in the palace!  Most palaces let you see only a handful of rooms.  We were in there for over three hours!  We must‚Äôve picked the right day and time because we only saw one tour group and it was just the three of us in most of the rooms along with the staff.  This palace was nice.  A lot of the original items were destroyed in the bombings during WW2.  So, what you see are restored items or items that came from other palaces. We found the audio tour useless. It gives you too much information.  If you were to listen to every detail, you‚Äôd be in the palace over four hours or more.

Date of experience: April 2019,Not flexible,"Other than the antiquarium, the rest of the exhibits / rooms weren't really impressive. They are more the same as each other and some rooms had missing items here and there. The residenz is huge and they have directional arrows to indicate which way you should walk. However there are parts where it is split into two directions. However be aware that once you choose a path, you would not be allowed to reverse. I think this is a good plan if the place is packed with visitors to allow a smooth transition from room to room, but on a day when there is minimum visitors, flexibility or common sense should be used. They basically have one attendant at every corner to enforce the above rule however my wife dropped her cardigan that was hanging off her bag at one area but when we return, it was gone. We asked the attendant and he told us he did not see anything and to go to the baggage storage area where we were also told no one returned it. I find it incredible that there was an attendant in almost every corner yet no one saw a dropped cardigan.

Date of experience: April 2019,"A ""Must-Visit"" while in Munich","Of course!  You have to visit the Munich Residence (the largest city palace in Germany) while in the city. It's located almost in the Marienplatz, so it's very easy to include in your visit.Remember that there are now four parts to your visit:  The Residence Museum, The Treasury, The Cuvilles Theatre and now the Royal Palace.  All are within the same complex and begin at the ticket office, but entrances are in various parts of the interior.Give yourself two hours minimum and easily 3-4 hours if you're really interested in the history offered via free audio guide and posted descriptions.The Residence was used from 1623 through 1918 and The Royal Palace was added and used beginning in 1825. You enter the Royal Palace from room 71, first upper floor,  after you've gone into the Residence, and then wind your way around and exit the same way to continue your tour of the Residence.It's easy to miss the Treasury's entrance, so be watchful about that.Each of the four sites are different and absolutely deserve a visit.  Entry times vary, depending on the season.The best news is that, while all shops are closed on Sundays in the Marienplatz, the Residence, et al, is open.

Date of experience: March 2019,Medieval palace in the heart of Munich,A very unique and historical place that one needs lots of time. It was the center of Bavarian royalty. I went less than two hours before closing and was only able to do the residence part with over hundred rooms and managed to just read the labels and walk through. There‚Äôs also the treasury collection which didn‚Äôt get to see.,50,"Mississauga, Canada",Trip type: Traveled solo
Date of experience: June 2018,"June 2018: Diamonds, statues, paintings, & decorative arts - room after room; Must see!  practical tips for visiting","The Residenz  was a palace for the Wittelsbach dynasty.  Now, it is a modern museum.   Bombing destroyed almost all of the original building during World War 2 (Munich was the birthplace of the Nazi movement, and was an Allied target for that reason).  What you experience when you visit is a recreation of the palace; filled with paintings, tapestries, jewels, clocks, and other decorative arts.   The collection‚Äôs scope is amazing and a must-see.  The recreation includes the Cuvillies theater, a beautiful Rococo masterpiece (clearly modeled after the theater at Versailles, but more intimate and ‚Äì for the tourist ‚Äì far more accessible).  The Cuvillies theater‚Äôs interior is one of the few remaining original parts of the palace.  Before bombs destroyed the palace, caretakers disassembled the interior, and stored it out of harm‚Äôs way.  The one other original part of the palace to survive is the antiquarium ‚Äì a renaissance hall filled with statuary and paintings.   The antiquarium alone is worth the visit.How much time: it‚Äôll take at least four hours, easily, and you may have time to walk through all the rooms, but not enough to immerse yourself in the exhibits.   One could spend the whole day ‚Äì maybe two ‚Äì to see everything.Tickets: you can buy tickets for the residenz or the theater, or both.   Do both.   The best ticket is the Mehrtagesticket ‚Äì 44 Euros ‚Äì for two adults for 14 days to visit all the Bavarian state museums and gardens.  It will get you into the museum and theater.   Kids 18 and under are free.Getting there: don‚Äôt drive.  Use buses or the underground.   The closest underground stop is Odeonsplatz. Alternatively, you could hop off the U at Marienplatz, see the Rathaus and the animatronic clock, then walk to the Residenz (or vice-versa).  Buses are also easy to use.  Alternatively, you could rent a bike.  There‚Äôs a huge bike rack in the Max Joseph Platz.  Note: bikes are big in Munich ‚Äì they‚Äôre everywhere.  Strangely, Germans, for the most part, don‚Äôt seem to wear bike helmets.  If renting a bike, I‚Äôd sure get a helmet.  There‚Äôs a lot of automotive traffic on the streets and lots of pedestrians in the pedestrian malls; all making for potential spills that could ruin a trip in a moment.Who will enjoy:  Adults and teens who can appreciate history and/or art will enjoy the visit.  Anyone younger than 13 will likely endure the visit, but with not that much humor.Staff:  they speak enough English, for the most part, to help you get by.  As always knowing some German is not only polite and greatly appreciated, but also an excellent way to truly enjoy your visit.Food: you can find something to eat at a couple wine bars on Residenzstrasse, or other restaurants nearby, but not in the museum.  If you want water, like the rest of Germany, you need to pack your own.   Water fountains seem to be an American thing.  You can refill your water bottle in the WC.Entrances:  there are two that count ‚Äì from the Residenztrasse and Max-Joseph-Platz.  The platz entrance is the easier to use. These are the only two entrances that get you to the ticket desk.  Go here first, then go to the other entrances to see courtyards and the theater.Selfie sticks:  leave them at home.  They‚Äôre verboten!!  And, the staff is obsessed with keeping them out of the museum.Prepping for the weather: even in June, it can get cold and you can get soaked with rain.  Our day in Munich was rainy and mostly in the fifties to sixties.  We had umbrellas, (courtesy of our hotel) and they were worth the trouble of carrying as otherwise we‚Äôd have been soaked.  Make sure you pack a sweater, at least, and, to be well prepared, a water resistant wind-breaker.",40,"San Francisco, California",

Date of experience: January 2019,Assolutamente da visitare,"Le visite sono 3 e si possono acquistare biglietti separati o cumulativi, una per il palazzo, una per il tesoro e l‚Äôaltra per il teatro.  E‚Äô assurdo che nonostante il notevole afflusso di visitatori ci siano solo 2 casse aperte. L‚Äôaudioguida (gratis) √® solo per il palazzo e il tesoro.  Dopo la fila per acquistare il biglietto, si lasciano zaini o borse ingombranti al guardaroba. Per il teatro occorre uscire e quindi rivistersi.Il palazzo √® veramente grande ed il percorso labirintico, anche se segnalato, poich√© su pi√π piani. Nonostante l‚Äôattenzione  e la cartina, un ala l‚Äôabbiamo saltata. Seguendo le indicazioni per il percorso pi√π lungo si ridiscende alle stanze dei nibelunghi, da l√¨ si pu√≤ uscire ma non pi√π rientrare nel percorso museale (perdendo ad esempio la galleria degli antenati) quindi si ci vede costretti a dover ritornare indietro.Nonostante tutto √® un‚Äôattrazione di Monaco che va assolutamente visitata. Molto √® ricostruito ma in ogni caso rimane intatto il fascino per questa dimora storica.

Date of experience: January 2019,Meravigliosa Residenza regale,"Venire a Monaco e non visitare la Residenz dei monarchi di Baviera sarebbe un grosso errore. La dimora regale √© bellissima, sfarzosa e molto grande, con i soli 7 euro del biglietto d' ingresso si passa di stanza in stanza, una pi√∫ bella dell' altra, immergendosi in molti secoli di storia bavarese. Sebbene un' ampia ala della residenza sia andata distrutta a seguito dei bombardamenti alleati durante la II guerra mondiale, gli ambienti e gli arredi, anche quelli ricostruiti, rimandano perfettamente al fascino di un tempo perduto.

Date of experience: March 2018,"Beautiful museum, don't miss the Treasury","My husband and I toured the Residenz while using the audio tour.  We really enjoyed ourselves and learned  a lot about Bavarian history.  Definitely see both the palace living quarters and the Treasury; it's worth it.  Allow a minimum of two hours, three would be better.The Residenz was the in-town home of the very wealthy ruling family of Bavaria, the Wittelsbachs.  The first buildings at this site were erected in 1385.  The Treasury houses the riches of the Wittelsbach family that ranges in time from the early Middle Ages to the Neo-classical period.  It includes the crown of the English Princess Blanche (Blanche of Lancaster), the oldest known surviving crown of England.  When she married into the Wittelsbach family it became their property as part of her dowry.  It is also known as the Bohemian Crown or the Palatine Crown; it is thought to have been made after about 1370 and is the best surviving example of Gothic goldsmithing.  It looks as if it would belong to a fairy-tale princess.  It, the Bavarian Crown jewels, the Crown of Therese of Bavaria, and the statue of St. George and the Dragon are the absolute highlights.",50,"Hudson, Wisconsin",Trip type: Traveled as a couple
