Date of experience: August 2020,Interesting visit,Nice museum to visit as it is also within a nice walk In the Olympic Parc. The museums offer a walk in the years of technology and design and it is quite interesting. ,40,"Rome, Italy",
Date of experience: February 2020,Super delusion,"I had great expectation from this museum and I have to say I had been highly disapponted.   The path to follow is not clear at all, and it should be, since it's arranged on multiple levels.  It doesn't exhibit so many cars and they lack of a proper historical explaination.  Alfa",20,milano,
Date of experience: August 2020,A dream,"One of the bucket list ticked off. I drove 5 hours from Slovenia to go and see it and I was not disappointed. Sure, it's a bit tedious when there are screaming kids around due to the imclement weather, but, it was really very good. The only thing, the parking isn't very well",50,"London, United Kingdom",
Date of experience: July 2020,"Great museum, missing some interaction ","Off course it’s very beautifull here, especially when you are a car enthousiast! What I am missing is the more interactive tools in this museum, it is more like an “old school museum” ",40,"Dongen, The Netherlands",
Date of experience: July 2020,Excellent Museum,"This was our first visit to the BMW Museum, and it didn't disappoint.  It was really setup well, so you circle down through the different eras of BMWs, including the early 1920's, war years and modern times. They also have a great section on innovation.  The museum's also right",50,"Stuttgart, Germany",

And the Cold War / Berlin Wall history section was totally out of place in a car museum.This museum was not worth the €10 admission unless you know absolutely nothing about BMW and are starting from scratch.",20,,Trip type: Traveled as a couple
Date of experience: January 2020,Excellent place.,Museum is superb and all the models of Bikes and cars right from beginning are placed. Good experience. Even future car models also placed. Must visit when in Munich. Even Factory visit also available. Take guided tour to understand better.,50,"Mumbai, India",
Date of experience: January 2020,Holy Grail for BMW fans,"The museum sets out the history of the aircraft engine-turned-car manufacturer, which is relatively short and therefore the collection of vintage cars is not as impressive as that of say grand old Mercedes Benz. If you can walk for 2 hours, join the factory tour which shows the concurrent production of 3 models in one production system from stamping, welding, painting to assembly, although you will be nowhere near where the shiny cars roll off the production line ready to be driven away. There’s a lot of walking up and down stairs and can be taxing for some people! Photo taking is not permitted inside the factory.",40,"Hong Kong, China",

Porsche and Mercedes museum both 10 euro admittance (kids free), and both were awesome (spent multiple hours in each) for adults AND kids. BMW museum charged us 17 euros, and was a one hour deception. Just 2 race cars, not a single car where the kids could sit at the wheel, and also the souvenir shop a bit boring and overall more expensive than Porsche and Mercedes.Bmw racing engines alley and m1/m3/m5/m6 platform were not dissapointing i must say.",10,"Goirle, The Netherlands",Trip type: Traveled with family
Date of experience: February 2020,Trip advisor recommended ,As the title suggests we went here because of the trip advisor reviews. Because it is out of season understandably some parts of the museum are undergoing work but that in no way detracted from the enjoyment. Everything was spotlessly clean and there was also a nice cafe. I found the whole museum and the bmw story fascinating and spent over 2 hours there. Tickets were very reasonable at €10. The cars and motorcycles were beautiful,50,,Trip type: Traveled with friends

Has a wide range of BMWs throughout the time, with history of the company's creation. Well worth a visit for car enthuasists! Also has a cafe.

Date of experience: January 2020,Passing time at a museum well worth the visit.,This museum is well positioned near the U Bahn so transport to or from is not an issue. Obviously it is a serious plug for BMW but in saying that it is interesting. From motor bikes to cars it can be quite a lot to take in. The walk is quite lengthy and may be an issue for people who would rather see a more compact display. You will need to allow at least a couple of hours so if your planning on seeing this museum than heading to the Olympic Site you will have to allow enough time.,40,"Sydney, Australia",Trip type: Traveled with friends

It even has its own cafe.",40,United States,

Date of experience: January 2020,Good for car enthusiasts,I thought the museum would be a little more interesting.  It took our family about 45 minutes to visit the entire museum.  Not sure if it is worth the money for the amount of time it took to go through.,30,"Le Havre, France",Trip type: Traveled with family
Date of experience: January 2020,Disappointing ,"Went to the BMW museum with very high expectation. Costs €10. The entire tour is about 45 minutes to an hour.

It is very well constucted, lots of interactive attractions, some design, art and history, too. We arrived at the time museum opens and then there was not a queue to the ticket booth.

Date of experience: December 2019,A must for BMW enthusiasts,"If you love BMWs visiting this museum is a must.  But the museum isn't as well laid out as other car museums (Ferrari, Lamborghini, etc).  There really isn't a flow to the exhibits leaving visitors to wander as they wish without following a story or history line.",30,"Waterloo, Belgium",

The ‘People Flow’ was not as good as other museums.Some nice cars, not a huge place.Still worth a visit.",30,"Canton of Geneva, Switzerland",Trip type: Traveled with family
Date of experience: December 2019,Half the tour is a commercial!,"We enjoyed looking at the cars at the Welt, but were looking forward to more history of BMW, especially its history in air transport. The upper half of the exhibit is one long commercial for the new BMWI and how electric cars are going to save the planet. While pushing the concerns over oil production, they skip over the amount of mining that battery production will require. The lower half of the museum is focused more on this history of the company, but mostly on the auto production. They do have some cool cars in the “treasury.”",30,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",Trip type: Traveled as a couple
Date of experience: December 2019,A must for a BMW or car enthusiast!,"Very nice building and place to have a museum and send off new BMW owners with their cars. I also attended a tour of the manufacturing facility- which was okay, but not stellar compared to the VW Glasfabrik in Dresden.",40,,
Date of experience: December 2019,It is average museum ,"I visited this museum and expected to find something exciting from the exhibition, well i was a bit disappointed about the small museum.

Date of experience: December 2019,Worth a visit,"The numbers of cars and history to view is very good. However, appeared to be going through extensive renovation and this may have deterred from the overall pleasure of viewing these wonderful cars.

We also combined this with a visit to the BMW showroom which was an equally spectacular building.",40,"Dundee, United Kingdom",
Date of experience: December 2019,"Huge factory, great showroom","Stopped here as part of a tour. Really nice showroom with a lot of cars on display.

The manufacturing plant is older and has been upgraded several times to meet changing technology. Unfortunately, you are not permitted to take any pictures of the manufacturing areas. BMW has one of the most modern European deliveries and staging areas of all the German competitors. You get to review your new automobile on a revolving platter, presented to you by a BMW technical consultant to explain all the new technology.   The BMW main entrance has a forum display area of current and future models of BMW, Rolls Royce, Mini, BMW Motorcycles, BMW M Performance series and of course a gift shop. The museum is only a short walk over the raised walkway, which contains a full life history of the Bavarian Motor Works, a very impressive display of their cars, engines and motorcycles throughout the years. The museum also incorporates a good display of concept cars that show the future for BMW. BMW is a must see for any auto buff, with so much history and technology that helped advance the automotive industry in the past and into the future.",50,,
Date of experience: December 2019,BMW,There are two buildings we have had more enjoyable time at the first building which saled cars and motorcycles of BMW.

Date of experience: December 2019,Fun and interesting,"Great view of cars and the lineage of BMW. Great history course. A ton of innovation displayed. They are doing a lot of renovation and some areas are closed. Interestingly they get into some recycling questions and note that their batteries are the way of the future.. unfortunately the fail to address what happens to old batteries when their ""second life"" as they call it, ends. They also fail to address how much energy is used to get battery materials. Also tge cost of making electricity, the standard failure when talking about electricity which use oil to be generated.

Date of experience: December 2019,"Nice Museum, Great for BMW lovers",This is a great museum for those people who have serious technical interest in BMWs and the development of them over time.

A staff opened a bonnet of one of the vintage cars to explain how it was used during a race. The temporary exhibition upstairs had interesting statistics related to emissions and related technology. Enjoyable and good on a rainy day especially for adults & older kids. We struggled to find a lift to access different floors. (Our toddler son was asleep on a pram... ) You actually have to ask the receptionist to operate the lift in order to access floors other than the lockers. You still will have to manage some steps to access all areas.

Date of experience: September 2019,BMW History; in a nutshell,"Not normally an auto museum person, but two reasons to hit this one; always loved the cars and currently have three of the motorcycles, one of which is in here.if you aren't a BMW aficionado, yes you may feel the admission is a little steep. The museum entrance starts in the middle; 3 levels wrap up the inside of the building, with an equal number of floors below ground. We went up first, and were becoming more disappointed with every step. This area deals with ""green"" energy and the steps BMW is taking to become a more ""responsible"" world partner. While there were some very unique concept cars and cutaways, most of the upper area is an appeasement to the people who rather see this industrial icon shut down. It felt like I had paid to be lectured to. Final started the downward spiral to the real museum. Cars, motorcycles, and engines from the other fields. While they did have a few airplane engines, it would have been nice to see a completed one, even if it was a replica in this area. There was a wonderful room with a progression of BMW engines. They had quite a few of the classics, ralleye cars, and others. My big disappointment here was the wall of motorcycles, which is three floors tall. It was under construction and closed off from viewing. I was unable to view my beloved Chromehead on display. Staff advised that this area would be under construction until at least May 2020. Other wise the whole museum is open.",40,"Omaha, Nebraska",
Date of experience: November 2019,BMW History Tour,"Loved the BMW tour. Go in both buildings so that you see the old and new vehicles. The buildings are a sight to see as well and the location is easy to get to. We loved seeing the old cars and engines of them all . Colors, leather, and the sizes over the years was very interesting.",40,,
Date of experience: October 2019,Not worth it,I love cars however this museum was very underwhelming. It is basically different BMW's from different time periods-not much information. Save your money,20,"Folsom, California",
Date of experience: October 2019,A giant BMW advertisement,"This has to be the worst ""museum"" I've ever visited. Sure, it's massive, flashy and visually pleasing, but it's nothing but BMW propoganda. At least half the museum is literally a showroom of their new eco-friendly cars. The story presented of BMW's history conveniently ignores the period between World Wars and the Nazi ties to the company (becuase, propoganda). If it was a free exhibition, great, but the fact that it costs a family of 5 almost $100 to visit is a joke. It's crazy to me that this is considered one of Munich's top tourist destinations, but then again, it goes to show the power that these huge corporations have over the local economy.",10,,

Date of experience: October 2019,Not a museum... a waste of time and money,"We were very disappointed with the BMW Museum.  It was just one giant advertising campaign for BMWs.  Given the history of the company, there should have been more about the historical perspective, especially about the company's role during WWII.  We found that perspective was ""hidden"" down a remote hall with fast rolling slide shows.  This was very disappointing.",10,"Hockessin, Delaware",

Takes about 1-1.5 hrs to complete (if I remember correctly) but it is very thorough.Seeing all of the vintage cars, cars from the 70s/80s/90s was amazing especially when stacked together as a visual progression. Entrance fee was quite good for the two of us.

Some of the  exhibits were closed off due to renovations but we saw and learned a great deal.We did a self guided tour without the audio and did fine. So many of the displays are equipped with language and even videos that explain so much, just watch for the metal spots on the floor to turn them on.

Date of experience: October 2019,Historical and Unique,"When entering the museum, it is divided into two sections - the older models vs. newer models. You may choose which area you would like to view first. We did not have a tour guide and I am not sure if you may acquire one at the museum (something to look into). On some models located on the floor there is a wifi symbol if you step on this symbol, descriptive audio about the model will play from the speakers in the ceiling above you. This museum is a must see if you very much enjoy cars and the history behind each car. There is a cafe and souvenir shop located in the museum, and if you head across the bridge to the BMW welt, there is a larger souvenir shop with BMW and Mini Cooper merchandise combined, which also has a Rolls Royce that you can view across from the shop.",40,"Ancaster, Canada",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

Date of experience: September 2019,It was okay,"Overall I thought it was just okay.  All the displays had English written and voice translations so that was great!  I did learn a lot about BMW, its cars and heritage.  The museum was undergoing construction so the route meandered a bit and had a few dead-ends.  Hopefully after construction the flow will be improved.  You also have to walk up the ramp reading the displays then take an escalator back down.  It should be the other way around.  There were a bit too much information on the E (electric) car and project for my tastes.  I drive a BMW so I was hoping for more from the museum -- in the battle of museums Mercedes Benz wins.",30,,

Parking is underground and uses te typical European system of getting a ticket, then paying the ticket n the way out at a kiosk before you get in your car. The BMW Welt is nothing more than a glorified dealership showroom though. If you're interested in buying a BMW the Welt is ok, but otherwise it's nothing special. But it's free and the Welt - Museum are connected so you will walk thru it to get to the Museum.If you want to do the Factory tour you need to book your reservation a month before, we didn't so missed the factory tour.

Date of experience: September 2019,BMW history at its best!,This museum is easily one of the best museums if you are into cars but also the best way to learn the history and experience about what BMW is all about. I managed to spend three hours going from each of the exhibits that are contained in this very large modern complex and see as much as I can see. I also checked out the cafe and shop as well but I feel this is where they could have improve it the most. Perhaps the range of foods and drinks could be improved more and the range of merchandise could have been greater and better qualities to enhance the experience of visiting this place to make it even more fun and enjoyable.,50,"Melbourne, Australia",Trip type: Traveled solo
Date of experience: September 2019,A Visit to Munich BMW Museum- by Selim Bozok,"Munich is home of BMW. BMW is home to it's museum. The place is very easy to reach by U8 via Marianplatz.

On your right is the car delivery and model lineup exhibition building.This is my fourth visit to a major car brand's museum, these being Ferrari (Modena), Porche and Mercedes (Stuttgart) and BMW (Munich).BMW museum building has a very attractive design. A spiral staircase envelops the exhibitions of engines, motorcycles and old and recent BMW models. The ground floor has the jewels of the museum, vintage bmw's.At the entrence are situated a coffee and a shop. Plan to spend 2 hours at the museum.Leaving the museum, always visit the new car delivery building which has a striking design.Inside you can examine all current models and spend some of your currency at the BMW lifestyle shop.If you have the chance to visit these museums, start with Stuttgart, 2 museums in one day, then Munich BMW and leave Ferrari (Modena) to the end.",50,"Istanbul, Turkey",

It was great to see a good collection of historical cars on show and also the motorcycles. There was also an exhibition on when we were there on what the company is doing in relation to producing 'green' cars for the future which was very interesting.Everything is laid out neatly and cleanly although you sometimes have to go off the beaten track into side rooms to view stuff.We were certainly not disappointed with our visit which, along with BMW Welt, took up most of our day. One thing though, it was 10 Euro to enter. A great PR exercise would be to be free entry for BMW owners. After shelling out £40K on a car, the least they could do is let me in for free!",50,"Hockley, United Kingdom",

We took the English guided tour which showed us the highlights of the main exhibit (which I highly recommend if you don't know much about cars).

Got off the train, let a taxi driver know that I wanted to go to BWM Welt, and he pointed behind me. It was about a 10-15 minute walk. I didn’t go to the museum part because there was a lengthy queue (which I expected from other reviews) but I did go to the Welt—the showroom. Expected to see only BMWs and there were plenty but there were also Mini Coopers and a couple of Rolls Royces.

You may then enter what is essentially the most exquisite car dealership you may ever see. All of the new BMW models are on display as well as many not available in the USA. Additionally there are various race cars and quite a few motorcycles on display. BMW also owns the Mini Cooper and Rolls Royce brands which are represented. There is also a nice store and a number of eateries within the complex ranging from snacks to the Bavari which is a nice sit down restaurant. After almost two hours we finally wandered over the bridge to the actual museum. We paid 14 Euro for entry and a one hour tour. Regular entry without a tour is 9 Euro. The tour was well worth the price with some great info being presented and the guide opening up engine compartments and doors for a number of the cars. I was surprised that we could walk up t almost all of the cars, including a 3.5 mil Euro model! Overall, our visit was very enjoyable and educational. If you like cars it is a must see.",50,"Islip Terrace, NY, United States",

We did not stay that long, but here are some of the highlights:(1) If you love motorcycles, you can sit on one or more styles of bikes.  My husband was in heaven.(2) There is a viewing area on the 2nd floor where you look across the way to watch customers pick up their new vehicles.  We were told on average 150 new vehicles are picked up each business day.(3) BMW owns Cooper Mini and Rolls Royce, so in the show room you can see all 3 brands (and talk to a salesperson if you are interested).(4) If you are a BMW lover there is a gift shop where can buy BMW-branded merchandise.(5) We saw lots of families and 2 school trips, so this is definitely kid-friendly.",40,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",

Date of experience: June 2019,Awesome,"Loved the building before we even got inside.  There isn’t a huge collection of cars but it followed the history of engine development from the beginning of BMW.There were planes, boats, motorbikes, and of course, cars.However, the way of the future, was probably the most interesting and it gave you faith that change is on the way.  With development of cleaner motors and the recycling of what is now waste, there are obviously som incredibly talented and dedicated visitors out there.Just be warned, you cannot take backpacks or large bags inside, and when we went to enter there were no crowds, but after husband went all the way back to the lockers, disposed of the backpack and returned, we had quite a long wait to enter.Well worth a visit.",40,New Zealand,

Date of experience: August 2019,Worth Doing,It’s a hop on hop off bus so most people should know what to expect.

BMW Welt is free to go into whereas the museum cost 10 euro each.  I think this was worth it as is interesting, very well laid out although some areas don’t flow and you have to back track a little.  Great examples of motorbikes, airplane and cars including racing cars from many years ago giving the details and history in both German and English.

Date of experience: July 2019,BMW Welt tour,"I booked this English guided tour about a month in advance direct with BMW World. The tour is described on their website and you just email your requirements and they book you on the tour. I paid 22 euros for the three and a quarter hour tour on the day.I checked in early, put my bag in a locker and checked out the temporary display near the central desk. The tour started at the museum and it was very good. Just the right amount of time in each area. Learnt so much about BMW past and present. Then we went on a tour of the factory. This was so fantastic - watching the robots doing the spot welding and then further on seeing humans assembling the cars. At the end of the factory building, there was a coach waiting to take us to another building. There we were instructed to put on blue BMW lab jackets to stay dust free - we then went into the paint spray workshop. There was a production line of cars rolling along and the robots sprang into action spraying the cars. New technology meant that the robots did whatever individual colour was needed for each car rather doing a whole run of just one colour.I was amazed and wished I could have taken some photos in the factory.The next part was the BMW World showroom. The cars are shown off in their best light. When the tour was over I returned to the museum to spend some more time on the bits that were missed in the tour.It was totally fantastic and worth every cent!!",50,"Derby, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled solo

It was very good and I would recommend for any car person. Well worth a 1/2 day. Museum tickets are pretty much walk up, but I heard the Werks (Factory tour) is even better, but you need to book far in advance.  Museum did a great job telling the history of BMW. In particular its section on green power and problems facing the automotive industry was very good.  In general , it was a bit over the top design and seemed to be designed by Apple.

The tour takes you through the history of vehicles, motorcycles and cars, BMW has made.  I had always wanted a BMW so being in Bavaria seemed the right place to visit.  It is the only real commercial activity we toured on our trip.  Let me say our tour guide was excellent and real made the tour great.  It last an hour and you have as much time as you want to wander back through.  We started in the imagination section were a bed of suspended metal balls raises and falls to create shapes.  We then visited the the first cars and motorcycles BMW made before visiting the clay room where they show you how the shapes are first made and tested.  Eventually you end on the ground floor with a number of classic BMW styles and some innovative stories.  Again everyone in our family enjoyed.  Also the exterior of the museum looks like a carborator with the HQ building, a four-cylinder engine.  Behind them is the assembly plant that makes every BMW in Bavaria.

It provides an overview of BMW's history, but it's really high level. There's a good split of coverage between bikes and cars, but only the well-known known models are shown. The general presentation is good, but the circuit/layout is poor. The electric vehicle exhibit is hokey and just a marketing tool for their new i-series. It's still worth your time to visit, but go in with the expectation that the museum is developed for a general audience instead of serious BMW fans.",20,Calgary,Trip type: Traveled as a couple

It is a relatively short u bahn trip from the Marienplatz area.  We were there early enough to miss the major crowds that were there when we finished.  There were a couple of school trips there as well (the children were well behaved and were not an issue).The museum is well laid out with lots of different areas devoted to the history and vehicles of BMW.  This includes motorcycles as well. The material provided for various displays was informative and succinct.  It included their history right up to their hybrid/EV models.On a side note as well had nice umbrellas from our hotel we did not want to cart them around and the front desk staff were very nice and put them in the back room for us to pick up later.

Date of experience: June 2019,A must for automotive history buffs,"I found this to be an excellently curated museum for anyone who's into the history of automobiles, motorcycles, and the internal combustion engine. The stylish facility is easy to navigate, well organized, and obviously the English translations are appreciated by those who don't speak German.I particularly enjoyed the exhibits depicting BMW's role during the Third Reich/WW2 era, and BMW's contribution to auto racing.  All in all, a great way to spend a morning or afternoon in Munich — exhaustive in scope, without being exhausting.",40,"Cary, North Carolina",Trip type: Traveled with friends

Date of experience: July 2018,Not worth spending tour day and entrance fees at a corporate showroom,"Most of the tourist keep BMW museum in the full day itinerary. It’s not worth incurring huge cost and spending a full day just to learn history of a car maker. Instead visit a good car showroom in the city where the dealer  will not charge entrance fees and instead provide you water and coffee too with an executive or engineer  to explain all about BMW cars and the required knowledge of other products of different companies too. After having spent 6 hours you don’t even find a guide or place or lounge to relax in a corporate hub for those who have travelled from different parts of the universe to gain knowledge and history of the largest car maker from GERMANY. In fact we at India are treated much better at BMW showroom or at the workshop. Rest of the tour May be done through YouTube online at the hotel after having visited the Museum by hop on from outside, this will take less than one hour to visit and another one hour at any dealers showroom to gain better knowledge of the car and the history of the company too.",20,"New Delhi, India",Trip type: Traveled solo

Date of experience: June 2019,"Great museum If you're into BMW cars, motorcycles & engines","Great presentation of all things BMW.  Arrive and pay the admission to get started.  Your tour will be on your own to wander (there are steps, ramps and elevators) with no tour map so be careful not to miss anthing.  I saw old cars and motorcycles dating back to the mid/late 1920's on through the years to some current presentations.  Motors through the years, jet engines, concept vehicles, they are all here and there is even a small cafe in case you need a break.  Everything seems to be signed/labeled so that you can read about what you are seeing.When through at this museum, don't forget to walk across the over-the-street ramp to the adjacent BMW building where they have current production vehicles for viewing.  Many of the cars can be sat in so be sure to have a friend take a few photos of you sitting in a really cool BMW.  Or check out the motorcycles that you can sit on and once again, go for the photos.  If you're a car or motorcycle person, this is a place for you.  Allow a couple of hours minimum.  Enjoy!!",50,"Clovis, California",

Date of experience: June 2019,"BMW Museum excellent mostly for adults, exhibit text in German and English","10 Euros is very good value for the Museum and tagging onto an English guided tour is a bonus plan.  Took about 5 hours to walk round and read most of it.Very happy.Not so good for kids because they will have to keep moving to see each exhibit, I don't even think teenagers would read the extensive BMW explanations. The M1 café on this site is good, but probably needs a Costa Express machine for those millions now addicted to Costa.  However, I did find an apple went well with my latte and pretzel.  They need to do a fresher type of pretzel and have the option of no salt like those in Bucharest. Impromptu, I met a fellow Englishman who was one of the few who bought and owed a red M1! We both agreed that a BMW inline 6 cylinder engine and rear wheel drive is why we have a life long addiction to BMW.  We both want to buy an i8 as a 'toy', 'the impractical doors make it a toy', but it does look good, although I will have to wait for the oldest to get to GBP 25K. We can also see the effect that the electric revolution is already having on sales decisions, 'fast petrol and diesel cars bought today will lose value very fast as electric cars take over'.   One day I look forward to an electric 5 series touring. This part is just my general opinion with cars and not in the museum.I do wish I still had my E30 320i, why is it that we can't switch our modern cars into 'drift mode'? (I believe an M2 can do it but I can't afford that.)Drifting is fun on round-a-bouts, no need to go to a race track, this is not a risky activity in the wet, constant practice makes you better.  (I accept that less than 1% of the population wish to 'drift' - but this is what the 'ultimate driving machine' should be able to do.All front wheel drive cars I've driven have a problem with not being able to drift properly (Mini, Renault, Audi, Honda). The front wheels just spin and go into understeer = depressing. An E30 will spin the rear wheels and go into oversteer, which on 'lifting off' the  throttle goes into more oversteer!, hence, makes it very entertaining.  A 'well sorted' car like the E39 is too easy, i.e. has to be pushed into oversteer and then too easy to bring it back.  This is why good E30's continue to go up in value = irreplaceable.",50,"Stevenage, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled solo

Date of experience: June 2019,Could be Better Organised,"This seemed like a must visit on our trip to Munich and a way to get away from the pollution of the main town for a short while, and it is an impressive museum with an awful lot of exhibits on display.  The problem is that they're a little mixed-up with no clear progression through the exhibits. There's also a lack of interactivity or context in some of the exhibits.  I hate to say this about a museum in Germany, but it's all a bit ""clinical""However if you're a car buff or a motorbike enthusiast (like myself) there is a lot to be interested in.They're also a bit particular about people touching the cars, which I totally understand, but if these are so delicate then fence them off. Don't have a staff-member perched on a stool shouting at people.  Not me by the way but some Asian tourists posing for photos who didn't understand the signs.  I did notice however that nobody stopped a young German girl from climbing all over one of the rally cars; one rule for some perhaps...?One tip I would give is that, while the cafeteria is OK, if you're hungry get across the footbridge to the BMW Welt as there's a great selection of food there.The museum is accessible by U-Bahn and is right next to the OlympiaStadion Zentrum station so getting here from the town is quite easy, except on Sundays when the direct train doesn't run.",30,"Pontyclun, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

The exhibition however is not curated well and is a mix and mash of too many themes thrown in together. One could easily miss sections of the exhibits due to the complicated navigation. There are not too many interactive displays. There are very few sitting spaces in the Museum and most of the iconic concepts were not on display! Such a pity for a true BMW fan.

Date of experience: May 2019,Wonderful but could be exhausting so take breaks ,"So we arrived at 0900 and the Museum and BMW Welt open at 1000. So off we trot looking for a coffee shop. 2kms walk later we find one. And 2kms walk back. We can go in now. Museum came first as we entered by the north entrance up on the plaza, and in through the shop,normally that comes at the finish? Well start and finish are in the same place. Head to the toilet facilities down the ramp one level. These don’t require a ticket. Get a very modern corporate vibe as we walk down the circular ramp inspired by the architecture and graphics (innovation imagination courage - you know the drill right???). Very clean facilities as you expect. Back up the ramp to buy tickets. Then back down the ramp to the lockers we saw just outside the toilets to deposit your back packs and bags that are not allowed inside the Museum. And back up the ramp to the gates carrying your camera that is allowed inside. Ok? By now there are lots of groups mingling about. Buy our tickets cost about $25EU. We’re directed to the gate and pass through on our ‘tour’. Ok start at the vertical wall of motorcycles- check. Lovely examples of classic to current day units displayed well. You start with the oldest and as you literally wind down the building stopping at each level that includes specialist displays for certain era, engines (amazing cut always and examples including formula 1 to aircraft and marine engines whoa this sentence should stop here lol. Whew. Loved the Design room, the classic car open spaces with many special units in show. Colorful very well presented with solid information on each display. Chinese wife trying to get her husband to sit on the display bike mmmmm... he got caught by the security there and suitably embarrassed. Good. There are simply some wonderful vehicles cars and bikes, engines and displays to see here. This Museum is a Munich must-do visit. Much more educational than BMW World that is basically a giant showroom. Just when you’re finished going down hey that’s not all the finish folks. Oh no no no. You now have to go through another set of gates and climb UP the ramp. Because the displays and information around the ramp and up to the top floors tell a story of the future. Based on BMW’s vision of mobility. This where you’ll find stories of the development of the new electric vehicles. Hybrids, car pooling and many many resources on design development and production of cars for the future. Perhaps you’ll find an appreciation of materials science through their stories of carbon fiber and so much more.Once suitably impressed again you can come down the escalators to the start finish area again. And if you like to do so take a wonderful snack in the excellent café. Wonderful variety of high quality cakes drinks and so on. Wonderful Pit Stop.Now you can return to the shop and buy your selections from the BMW brand - books models trinkets toys clothing etc. Before you exit.Once you’re spent it’s time to head over the bridge to BMW World. There you’ll discover cafes restaurants cars you can sit in bikes you can sit on vehicles to ogle at and specs to read. Combined into this one facility are spaces for dealer events, starting Factory tours, Premiere lounge for Customers and vehicle deliveries. Talk about an all in one BMW marketing platz/place! The Café’s are excellent again as you expect. Full wheel chair access here, lockers downstairs along with more toilet facilities. Lifts enable access to all the floors. BMW Sales staff often fly buy like it’s a busy airport! The young man on the Rolls Royce stand (no you can’t sit in the Rolls Rajesh) was the epitome of multi lingual politeness. Bravo to the youth of tomorrow, if he is any indication of the future! After a wonderful lunch and coffee break we left the building solid in the knowledge that BMW knows how to design build and execute both vehicles and experiences to a very high standard. Thanks BMW for being at the heart of engineering- both of these important things so well.Like I said earlier this is a must do for young and old. Come learn, be amazed and have fun all at once. Bavarian style. And the local train station is just outside so you continue your journey this way or take a toy train or just a stroll around the Olympia Park. Of course there’s more...come and discover it for yourselves. It’s potentially a lot of walking distance and you can pace yourself with the many cafes I’ve mentioned. It’s at least a 2 hour Museum visit and a 1 hour Showroom experience.

Date of experience: December 2018,BMWs are art!,"This museum treats it motorcycles and cars as art.  The motorcycles in particular look like sculptures since they are displayed in a giant multi-story display case.  All artfully display against a black background.  The highlight of the extensive car collection are the BMW art cars.  BMWs that are painted by top artists such as Jeff Koons and Andy Warhol.  These cars are literally priceless one of a kind artworks.  BMW commission approximately one each year.  This year an Asian woman artist was featured.  Half the museum is BMW's history and these vehicles beautifully displayed. The other half is more a look to the future featuring electric cars like the BMW i3 and more exotic fuel cell and self driving cars.  That part of the museum is more like a science museum with facts and figures and examples of high tech batteries and engines.  Across the street is BMW Welt which is basically a showroom for all the BMW brands including Rolls Royce, and Mini as well as BMW.  All well worth  most of a day.",50,"Alexandria, Virginia",

Date of experience: March 2019,Small and simple.,The museum is split in two parts.  The first section was a retrospective on BMW and was very nice and well organized.  The great BMW models were all there and well displayed.   The second  section on the future of BMW and was very underwhelming. The displays were mostly on the need for reusable resources and trying to make the argument for the need for electric cars.  No cars are displayed until you reach the top floor where they have the new all electric BMW.   Not much thought was put in to the Museum for the car enthusiast.  We had the change to visit both the Porsche and Mercedes Museums on a previous visit to Germany and found they to be much more impressive.

Date of experience: February 2019,Slightly disappointing,Not a boring museum but I was slightly disappointed by the limited number of cars dating from the 1930s to the 1960s. In a way this is logical as the 328 was arguably the only truly successful pre-WW2  BMW and the two decades after the war were wobbly for the Bavarians. So the exhibits are less exciting than the fabulous cars in the Porsche and the Alfa Romeo museum.On the other hand do yourself a favor and book a factory tour.

Must visit the shop in the museum as it has many affordable nick nakcs that can be picked up. do check out the BMW branded watches some of them are really cool.Be sure of the GST refund business that gets done there as I am yet to receive the refund(not that I am missing it). the personnel at the counters are also really helpful.stick to black coffee with milk if you are looking for strong coffee in their coffee shop as the macchiato served generally in Germany is more like a cafe latte.,40,"Mumbai, India",Trip type: Traveled on business
Date of experience: January 2019,Amazing museum - extremely well organized - the art cars are fantastic,Visited with my 21 year old son and had a great time.  Download the app and bring a headset so you can listen to the narrations throughout the museum.  Fantastic collection.  We learned a lot about the brand and it's history.  Many new and interesting bits of information.  Give yourself at least 2 hours and maybe more if you want to listen to a lot of the narrations.,50,,

Date of experience: October 2018,Files of history,The place was on my list for some years now and I was able to visit it in a very cold autumn day. The effect was amazing - after the visit I was smilling and the cold outside became bearable. The building looks impresive and the museum is far from being boring.  It's definitely a must in Munich!,50,"Bucharest, Romania",
Date of experience: January 2019,Disappointed - Visit ruined by private function,"We arrived at 4pm fully intending to stay until closing time at 6pm and very excited to be at the BMW museum. We were told on entering that a private function was being set up which would restrict viewing of the Art Cars. This was not a major concern for us, as the art cars were not a high priority for us. After viewing the first few levels of BMW history which was quite interesting, we were confronted by dozens of staff moving chairs, setting up displays, food, drink, and sound systems. We felt quite unsafe and unwelcome, and could not proceed on the tour at all. Not only could we not see the art cars, but also blocked off were the M-Cars and everything else beyond that.  We left bitterly disappointed by about 5pm. This is the worst €20 we have spent during our entire trip. We suggest that the price should have been halved, and the areas where the function was being held closed to the public. We could not believe that at 5pm they were still selling full price tickets to unsuspecting public. Deceptive and misleading BMW. Shame on you.",20,"Eagle Point, Australia",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

We bought our own tickets for the vintage museum. I am not a BMW owner, (wife is) but the collection will blow you away. Pristine cars, cycles, etc on multiple levels.

It is an easy museum for families to walk through, and very easy to find. However, there is no information about the history of the company, or how the product evolves.

Date of experience: December 2018,"From a non-car person, very interesting!","I don't really ""do"" cars, but given that BMW could be considered an industry leader, and I'm familiar with some of their cars, I was very interested in the museum.  Easy to get to by train, relatively cheap entry, and with an engaging tour guide (tour maybe $E3 extra?) It was a lovely way to spend a cold, wintry afternoon in Munich.  Great to see early vehicle designs, particularly the motorbikes (which I love!).  The exhibition about future directions was also fascinating, particularly the way in which they are recycling materials etc - and it was a pleasant surprise to hear that BMW had pulled out of F1 to focus on more sustainable pursuits.

Date of experience: December 2018,Unpredictable,I give them an average review because we could not visit the museum during museum hours and therefore cannot comment on the quality of the exhibits. They might have been fantastic. We had contacted BMW about tour reservations for that very day and they had failed to tell us that the museum would be closed for an event.

We explored the entire museum, hung out in the cafe and we even made the 10 minute walk to the Olympiapark and tower across the bridge, a fun way to spend time before the Ultimate Factory Tour. There’s lots of fascinating perspective on BMW’s ascent to the Ultimate Driving Machine, but the layout of the museum is a confusing maze causing you to repeatedly backtrack to see what you’ve missed. This may be by design or it may be due to some current construction but we would had missed large sections if we hadn’t",40,"Kirkland, Washington",

I would have liked to see more about the development of the cars.  They did show the motorcycle design through the years, but I wish there were more cars to view.

But there was motorbikes , aeroplane engines and pictures . Some of it was being refurbished , so big sections of BMWs history was cut off. 2 of the most iconic cars , the Z8 and 507 were not present , in the BMW mueseum!! Why ,BMW aren't they in there!!!.

Cos who needs all that hassle of having a car outside when you can use a BMW branded app to find a nearby car still warm from the last user. Hmmmm. Basically, if you like cars, motorbikes and engines you’ll be exicted throughout but most of it was just dull advertisement.",20,"Cork, Ireland",Trip type: Traveled solo
Date of experience: October 2018,Quite interesting,"Located adjacent to the distinctive BMW HQ, this is a museum of historic models, unlike the BMW Welt just a short stroll away which concentrates on the new models. It’s essentially divided in to an upper and a lower area, with the lower area concentrating on the older models and the upper area more of a “coming soon” section. There is an entrance fee of €10, and there is currently some redevelopment work going on with some sections being closed off. If you want a bottle of water from the café, that will cost you €3.50 – a quite ridiculous price I thought.The first part has a few very old aero engines on display, and it then moves on to quite a large collection of motorbikes with information boards in both German and English. After that it was the car section, and here I was a little disappointed, expecting to find many more examples than there were. Essentially there was just one example from an old 3, 5, 6 and 7 series, and these were stacked vertically so you could really see nothing apart from the underside of the upper ones. There were then a few more examples from the M range of cars, and these were at least at ground level so you could see them and walk around them and there were also some informative information boards on the wall. The final part of the lower section was described as “BMW Art” where cars are painted in weird and wacky colour schemes, as well as other car related artwork such as small model encased in a block of concrete. Overall there seemed to be far more motorbikes than cars which seemed a little odd since BMW are primarily known for their car range.The upper section was quite impressive architecturally with a long spiral ramp winding up to the top where an escalator takes you back down. This was devoted to sustainability and future trends such as electric and self-driving cards. Consequently a lot of the display material here was simply information boards, with slightly less physical things, although there were still quite a few abstract bits, such as a wiring loom to show case how much copper is used (35kg in a 7-series, if you wanted to know), examples of materials constructed from carbon fibre, and so on. The first section at the bottom of the ramp was all about mega cities and urban population density which seemed a bit at odds with a car museum, but it then moved on in to how mass transit might look in the future. The very top section included a couple of concept cars. Somewhat surprisingly, I probably found this more interesting than the older cars which I hadn’t expected, but perhaps that was just because there was a lot more material here to look at and read.Overall this was quite interesting, but the entrance fee was perhaps a tad steep and I’m not sure I’d bother making a special journey. If you’re in the area though and have an interest in cars, then it’s worth popping in.",40,"Bristol, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled with friends

The brand philosophy is felt in everything from individual showcase explanations to the overall museum presentation structure to the building architecture.

The ticket cost is €10 per person and you can wander around as much as you like.The good points:If you like engines and cars, this is a great place to visit. It shows the history of BMW from the start to present day and also gives you a look at the future prototypes. Its well laid out and has a lot to see. There are aircraft engines as well as motorbikes and the entire car range to be seen here. The bad points:Its a good trek around the museum if you want to see it all.

Date of experience: October 2018,Waste of time,"Well, this was just depressing. The selection of exhibited cars was an absolute minimum. A few M-models, and some art cars was really all there was. In the i/vision department it was lots of non-car stuff, like a pile of wood, and some palm-trees!? I want to see cars, not visit a warehouse or a park! An absolute minimum of cars in the museum, and it was also very difficult to find the logic route for the tour. Another drawback is that you have to walk uphill, and take the escalator down. If you are interested in BMW, go visit another museum, or a BMW dealer. As a BMW owner I  was really looking forward to this, but it was just depressing. The Porsche and MB museums are at a whole different level!",10,Norway,Trip type: Traveled with friends
Date of experience: October 2018,Must visit for car lovers ,If u like anything about cars - this is a must visit place. I have worked in the automobile industry and hence enjoyed it even more. But so did my husband and young 4 year old daughter. Take at least half a day for the visit. You can first take a guided tour which is only 3 euros more than the normal ticket and then choose where all you wanna go and spend more time. The guided tour is well worth the money. It’s amazing really. The museum has some wonderful exhibits and very easy to understand for the layman.  They explain the whole development process of a car right from drawing to clay model to concept car to actual production. They also have amazing history and surprisingly some beautiful art pieces in there. Also the formula one car is on exhibit. Have lunch at the bmw welt while there. The cafes there are great and serve some very tasty vegetarian pasta options. They also have a play station which is fun. They also offer plant tours but kids above 6 are only allowed. So we had to give that a miss. Overall if you love cars - it’s feels like Alice in wonderland. :) kids love it too. Must do while in Munich.,50,,Trip type: Traveled with family

Date of experience: October 2018,"Very rude staff, Little to do","Found the staff very rude, you have to put all bags into the ""cloakroom"" which is actually lockers, we didn't have a 1 euro coin and there was no one there to give change or a change machine. Asked at the cafe and the guy basically shouted no at me, I suggested using the tip jar and he shouted no.The ticket entry didn't work properly and there was no staff around to help. The museum is laid out really poorly, and there really isn't much on show. In the ""history"" section, they manage to totally skip over BMW's involvement in WWII which I thought was in pretty poor taste.I'm pretty surprised at the overall TripAdvisor score for this place and so thought I should add my experience here in case it saves someone else a trip!",10,"Munich, Germany",Trip type: Traveled as a couple

It's the delivery location if you're purchasing a vehicle.You'll get to watch the cars come up from the factory on a glass elevator, and presented to the new owner, anxiously awaiting.BMW has done it right, to make the experience very comfortable and memorable.

You'll see how design was celebrated here from the start - since 1917, when the company began making airplane engines. Motorcycles came next, followed by the first BMW sedan in 1929. Perfect descriptions on English under each model or stand on an E for English to hear the chief designer talk about his favorite cars in the ""treasury"".Getting there: From the city center, ride the U-3 to Olympia-Zentrum subway station. Exit and see the gray ""soup bowl"". Cost and hours: 10 euros self-tour, Tue-Sun 10 am - 18 pm, closed Monday, guided tour is offered as well (call ahead for times).
